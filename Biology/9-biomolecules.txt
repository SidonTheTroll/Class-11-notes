Biomolecules: the molecules that are found in living organisms 

Human body is made up of many chemicals and they contribute to the biomolecules 

• Human diet mainly consists of proteins, carbohydrates and fats 

Protein: C, H, O, N, S 
Carbohydrates: C, H, O 
Fats: C, H, O

Nucleic acid consists of DNA and RNA 
    Its components are C, H, O, N, P

Enzymes: C, H, O, N, S

• Approximately 27 different elements are found in the human body

Other elements: Calcium, Iodine, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Sodium, Zinc

Some animals also have gold and radioactive materials in their body 

Micro and macro nutrients:
    Micro: found in low quantities 
    Macro: found in high quantities

More micro nutrients: physiological disorders 
Less micro and/or macro elements: deficiency

Vitamin A, D, E, K: fat soluble 
Vitamin B, C: water-soluble 




2/6/23 

Amino acids: essential and non-essential
    Essential: cannot be made by the body and requires to get from food
    Non-essential: can be made by the body 

• There are 20 types of amino acids

>> Fats

Stored in the adipose tissue
Acts as an insulator 

Not used by the body right away and is reserved for emergencies

Cholesterol: bad and good

-ase = enzyme 

• All the biological processes require enzyme
• Catalyst enhances chemical reaction but is not present in the reaction


>>> Nucleic acid 

• Found in the nucleus, mitochondria and plastid 

• Protein controls enzymes 

• All the processes require ATP (C, H, O, N, P)


>> Ways to find components in a sample

> Dehydration
  Burning 
  > The result ashes have all the inorganic components 

or 

> Dissolved or crushed in Trichloroacetic Acid 
  Solution is filtered 
  > Separated into acid-soluble components and acid-insoluble components 

  Acid soluble components: bio-micro molecules
  Acid insoluble components: bio-macro molecules

<800 daltons -> micro nutrients 
>800 daltons -> macro nutrients 

Primary and secondary metabolite 

Primary metabolite: directly involved in normal growth, development, reproduction
Secondary metabolite: not essential for basic cellular functions but play crucial roles in various ecological and biological processes.

Glycogen: Whenever the body needs energy, glycogen produces supplies it

Seconday metabolite: eg.- antibiotic (produced by penicilium) {but the use of it by the organism remains unknown}

Some plants also have oil but the reason is unknown 

Oxalicacetic acid helps in photosynthesis 

• Antibiotic is known as the wonder drug of the 19th century 




>>> Biomacromolecules

Eg.- nucleic acid 

>>> DNA 

DNA: Deoxyrhibonucleic acid 

• Contains hereditary information (genes)
• Acidic in nature (negatively charged)
• It is a polymer 
• Double helical structure 
• Made of 2 strands of polynucleotide 
• 2 strands are antiparallel to each other

>> Composition 
1. Phosphate group 
2. Deoxyrhibose sugar (pentose sugar)
3. Nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine)
4. Paired by 2 bases: AT, CG

{Schematic diagram of DNA}

• dsDNA: Double-stranded DNA 

2n: 6.6 * 10^9 base pair
n: 3.3 * 10^9 base pair 


• Nucleoside: combination of sugar with any nitrogenous base 

• Phosphodiester bond: the linkage between the 3' carbon atom of one sugar molecule and the 5' carbon atom of another, deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA

A glycosidic bond is a covalent bond that forms between the anomeric carbon of a sugar molecule and another molecule, such as another sugar or a non-sugar compound. This bond is vital for the construction of complex carbohydrates, including disaccharides and polysaccharides, by joining sugar units together.

Hydrogen bonds in DNA are weak chemical bonds that form between complementary base pairs, specifically adenine (A) with thymine (T) and guanine (G) with cytosine (C). These bonds contribute to the stability and structure of the DNA double helix.

Nucleoside bond: A nucleoside bond is a linkage between a sugar molecule and a nitrogenous base in a nucleoside.

• Distance between 2 base pairs: 0.34 nano meters

>>> RNA

Rhibonucleic Acid 

Composed of phosphate group, rhibose sugar, and four nitrogenous bases, i.e., adenine, cytosine, uracil, and guanine.


Types: mRNA: Messenger RNA: Carries information about protein synthesis.
       tRNA: transfer RNA Respomsible for transfer of amino acid from cellular environment to ribosome
       rRNA: Ribosomal mRNA: forms ribosomes, which are essential in protein synthesis

RNA is a linear structure made up of single strand of polynucleotide

Structure
{Structure of RNA}


RNA virus: Ebola, infulenza, HIV 
DNA virus: herpes, smallpox, hepatitis B, adenoviruses, warts


>>> Enzyme 

Mainly made of protein along with co-factor

Without co-factor, enzymes cannot work. 

Prosthetic groups: tightly binded with the enzyme 
Co-enzyme: binds whenever required 
Metal-ions: attatch with protein part and  make the enzyme active or inactive


>> Mechanism of enzyme action. 

Lock and key theory method: enzymes have a specific site to activate in 

           Amylase 
Starch --------------> Maltose

Enzyme substrate complex: it is a non covalent complex composed of a substrate bound to the active site of the enzyme and it is formed during chemical reaction. 

Enzymes are substrate specific, i.e., it requires a specific substrate to work. 

These can be visualized like building blocks which lock onto each other 

Enzyme + substrate ----> Enzyme-substrate complex -------> Enzyme + product 

‣ No change will occur in the enzyme 

        Pepsin
Starch -------> No reaction
        Amylase
Protein --------> No reaction 

‣ For every specific enzyme, it has a specific substrate to accomodate 

denaturation of protein: lost of function permanently

Biomolecules: the molecules that are found in living organisms 

Human body is made up of many chemicals and they contribute to the biomolecules 

• Human diet mainly consists of proteins, carbohydrates and fats 

Protein: C, H, O, N, S 
Carbohydrates: C, H, O 
Fats: C, H, O

Nucleic acid consists of DNA and RNA 
    Its components are C, H, O, N, P

Enzymes: C, H, O, N, S

• Approximately 27 different elements are found in the human body

Other elements: Calcium, Iodine, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Sodium, Zinc

Some animals also have gold and radioactice materials in their body 

Micro and macro elements:
    Micro: found in low quantities 
    Macro: found in high quantities

More micro elements: physiological disorders 
Less micro and/or macro elements: deficiency

Vitamin A, D, E, K: fat soluble 
Vitamin B, C: water soluble

Amino acids: essential and non-essential
    Essential: cannot be made by the body and requires to get from food
    Non-essential: can be made by the body 

• There are 20 types of amino acids

>> Fat

Stored in the adipose tissue
Acts as an insulator 

Not used by the body right away and is reserved for emergencies

Cholestrol: bad and good

-ase = enzyme 

• All the biological process require enzyme
• Catalyst enhances chemical reaction but not present in the reaction


>>> Nucleic acid 

• Found in the nucleus, mitochondria and plastid 

• Protein controls enzymes 

• All the processes require ATP (C, H, O, N, P)


>> Ways to find components in a sample

> Dehydration
  Burning 
  > The result ashes have all the inorganic components 

or 

> Dissolved or crushed in Trichloroacetic Acid 
  Solution is filtered 
  > Separated into acid soluble components and acid insoluble components 

  Acid soluble components: bio-micro molecules
  Acid insoluble components: bio-macro molecules

Need of classification organise all the organisms based on the characters to make study easier. 

>>> How to classify 

Categorise on the basis of some fixed criteria. 

Morphological features: outside physical characteristics 

R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed the Five Kingdom Classification

Euglena has both chloroplast and has holozoic nutrition

Controversial microbes are placed in protista

Kingdom Monera 

They are Unicellular Prokaryotes 

Cell wall is not made of cellulose or chitin but peptidoglycan, a polymer of linked sugars and polypeptides

Monera -> archaebacteria, eubacteria 

Initially the RNA was formed in the cell but the origins are unknown 

RNA -> DNA 
Amino acid -> protein 
	Both combined and formed protoplasm which evolved into prokaryotic cell 

India became the top in milk production -> more cattle -> more archaebacteria (methanogen) -> more methane production -> Global warming 

Archaebacteria that has the capacity to digest cellulose is present in the cow's stomach. 

Organic materials that are present in ice caps are being digested by methanogenic bacteria and is forming methane. Global warming has created an issue of exposing this methane layer which will further increase global warming. 

Methane traps heat 4 times that of carbon dioxide. 

3 types of archaebacteria: 
	Halophilic: found in salt deposits
	Thermoacidophilic: hot springs and acidic environments 
	Methanogenic: produces methane from organic matter. 

Solid (capsule) or jelly-like substance (glycocalyx) protects the cell. 

The hair-like structure surrounding the cell is called flagella or cilia based on the length and function. 
	Cilia is short and covers the cell and flagella are long hair which help in the movement 


Probiotic capsules have living spores of lactobacillus which maintain the microenvironment of our intestine. 

Curd consumers already have lactobacillus in their intestine. 

Bacteria which causes stomach ache damages the lining of the intestine which is the cause of pain and irritation.

Ribosome, cell wall, RNA and DNA may be present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes 

Most of the Prokaryotes use anaerobic respiration 

All archaebactria are anaerobic 

Excess oxygen in biogas plant makes it useless because oxygen is toxic for archaebactria 

Plasma membrane was first studied in RBC 

Carbohydrate - Sugar - soluble in water, has taste 
			   Non-Sugar - insoluble in water, tasteless 

Glucose, fructose - monosaccharides
Sucrose - disaccharide
Starch, dextrin, cellulose - Polysaccharide

Types of bacteria based on structure: 
	Cocci, Bacilli, spirilla, vibro

Culture: taking an infected part and cultivating them for experiment. 


>>> Protozoa

Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms that belong to the kingdom Protista. They exhibit diverse forms and play essential roles in various ecosystems, while some species can cause diseases in humans and animals.

Antibiotics should be taking daily or else the bactiria will become resistant to it. 

Superbugs are powerful bacteria resistant to antibiotics. 

Gram positive -> get stained
Gran negative -> no staining

Gram positive bactiria have less lipids and they absorb the stain and retain the color. 
	However, its the exact opposite for Gram negative bactiria


>>> Nutrition in bactiria

(i) Autotrophic: Chemotrophic & Photoautotrophic 
(ii) Hetrotrophic: Parasitic, Saprophytic 

Parasitic: 
	Internal 
	External 

Cholera has outer digestion and when it releases the enzymes in our intestine, it causes swelling and the intestine cannot do its work of absorbing the water. Therefore the patient becomes dehydrated which is the main cause of deaths. 


When any decomposing matter is in the process bacterial external dipestion is the reason why is becomes slippery.

• Bacterias don't perform holozoic nutrition because cell wall is not digestable for them. 


Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is a cellular process by which certain specialized cells, called phagocytes, engulf and internalize foreign particles, such as bacteria, viruses, cellular debris, or other substances

Pinocytosis: Pinocytosis, also known as "cell drinking," is a non-selective process where the cell membrane invaginates and forms tiny vesicles to internalize extracellular fluid and its contents, allowing the cell to sample and uptake various solutes present in the surrounding environment.




Q1> What is Gram Stain? 
Q2> Distinguish between gram positive and gram negative.



A1> Gram stain is a widely used laboratory technique in microbiology for distinguishing and categorizing bacteria into two major groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The stain involves a series of steps, including applying a purple dye (crystal violet) to the bacterial sample, adding iodine as a mordant, decolorizing with alcohol or acetone, and counterstaining with a contrasting color (such as safranin). The stain differentiates bacteria based on their cell wall composition. Gram-positive bacteria retain the purple stain, appearing purple under a microscope, while Gram-negative bacteria lose the stain and appear pink or red after counterstaining. The Gram stain is valuable in bacterial identification and provides preliminary information about the potential pathogenicity and response to certain antibiotics.

A2> Gram positive: 
(i) Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, making up a significant portion of the cell wall structure.
(ii) During the Gram staining process, Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye and appear purple after decolorization.
(iii) The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is relatively simple, with peptidoglycan being the major component. It lacks an outer membrane.
(iv) Gram-positive bacteria are generally more susceptible to antibiotics that target the cell wall, such as penicillin. The thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls provides a target for these antibiotics.
(v) Many Gram-positive bacteria produce exotoxins, which are released into the surrounding environment and can cause various symptoms and diseases.

Gram negative: 
(i) Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner layer of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, located between an outer membrane and an inner cytoplasmic membrane.
(ii) During the Gram staining process, Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet dye and appear pink or red after counterstaining with safranin.
(iii) The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is more complex, consisting of an outer membrane composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and proteins, in addition to the peptidoglycan layer.
(iv) Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a protective barrier against certain chemicals and antibiotics. It also contains porins, which allow the passage of small molecules.
(v) Gram-negative bacteria produce endotoxins, which are components of the LPS in the outer membrane. These endotoxins can trigger immune responses and contribute to the symptoms associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.

> Bactirial reproduction

• Asexual is common. 

• Takes max 20 minutes. 

Nuclei -> cell 
	This process is called Amitosis 

• Sometimes, the cell also shows spore formation.	

In this process, the cell divides the nucleus within itself and the cell is bounded by the cell wall. When it is time, the cell wall bursts and releases all the spores in the surrounding medium. 


> Bactiriophage virus

Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacteria. They are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth, estimated to outnumber bacteria by a factor of 10 to 1. Bacteriophages play a crucial role in shaping bacterial populations and influencing microbial ecosystems.

Here are some key characteristics and aspects of bacteriophages:

Structure: Bacteriophages have a complex structure consisting of a protein coat called a capsid, which encapsulates their genetic material. They can have different shapes, such as icosahedral, filamentous, or complex structures.

Genetic Material: Bacteriophages can possess either DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The genetic material carries the instructions for viral replication and production of viral components.

Infection Process: Bacteriophages have a specific host range, meaning they can only infect certain types or species of bacteria. They use tail fibers or other specialized structures to recognize and attach to specific receptors on the bacterial cell surface. Once attached, the phage injects its genetic material into the host cell.

Replication: Inside the bacterial cell, the phage genetic material takes control of the host's cellular machinery and redirects it to produce viral components. These components are then assembled to form new bacteriophages. Eventually, the infected bacterial cell lyses (bursts open), releasing a large number of phage particles, which can go on to infect other bacteria.

Impact on Bacterial Populations: Bacteriophages are major drivers of bacterial evolution and diversity. They can exert selective pressure on bacterial populations, leading to the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria. Phages can also transfer genes between bacteria through a process called transduction, thereby contributing to horizontal gene transfer and the spread of genetic traits, including antibiotic resistance genes.

Applications: Bacteriophages have gained attention for their potential applications in various fields. They have been explored as alternatives to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria (phage therapy). Phages are also used in molecular biology research, genetic engineering, and as tools for detecting and quantifying bacteria

Need of classification organise all the organisms based on the characters to make study easier. 

>>> How to classify 

Categorise on the basis of some fixed criteria. 

Morphological features: outside physical characteristics 

R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed the Five Kingdom Classification

Euglena has both chloroplast and has holozoic nutrition

Controversial microbes are placed in protista 

Chitin - amide derivative of glucose

Tissue: group of similar cells performing a similar task

Kingdom Monera 

They are Unicellular Prokaryotes 

Cell wall is not made of cellulose or chitin but peptidoglycan, a polymer of linked sugars and polypeptides

Monera -> archaebacteria, eubacteria 

Initially the RNA was formed in the cell but the origins are unknown 

RNA -> DNA 
Amino acid -> protein 
	Both combined and formed protoplasm which evolved into prokaryotic cell 

India became the top in milk production -> more cattle -> more archaebacteria (methanogen) -> more methane production -> Global warming 

Archaebacteria that has the capacity to digest cellulose is present in the cow's stomach. 

Organic materials that are present in ice caps are being digested by methanogenic bacteria and is forming methane. Global warming has created an issue of exposing this methane layer which will further increase global warming. 

Methane traps heat 4 times that of carbon dioxide. 

3 types of archaebacteria: 
	Halophilic: found in salt deposits
	Thermoacidophilic: hot springs and acidic environments 
	Methanogenic: produces methane from organic matter. 

Solid (capsule) or jelly-like substance (glycocalyx) protects the cell. 

The hair-like structure surrounding the cell is called flagella or cilia based on the length and function. 
	Cilia is short and covers the cell and flagella are long hair which help in the movement 


Probiotic capsules have living spores of lactobacillus which maintain the microenvironment of our intestine. 

Curd consumers already have lactobacillus in their intestine. 

Bacteria which causes stomach ache damages the lining of the intestine which is the cause of pain and irritation.

Ribosome, cell wall, RNA and DNA may be present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes 

Most of the Prokaryotes use anaerobic respiration 

All archaebactria are anaerobic 

Excess oxygen in biogas plant makes it useless because oxygen is toxic for archaebactria 

Plasma membrane was first studied in RBC 

Carbohydrate - Sugar - soluble in water, has taste 
			   Non-Sugar - insoluble in water, tasteless 

Glucose, fructose - monosaccharides
Sucrose - disaccharide
Starch, dextrin, cellulose - Polysaccharide

Types of bacteria: 
	Cocci, Bacilli, spirilla, vibro

Culture: taking an infected part and cultivating them for experiment. 


>>> Protozoa

Antibiotics should be taking daily or else the bactiria will become resistant to it. 

Superbugs are powerful bacteria resistant to antibiotics. 

Gram positive -> get staiend
Gran negative -> no staining

Gram positive bactiria have less lipids and they absorb the stain and retain the color. 
	However, its the exact opposite for Gram negative bactiria


>>> Nutrition in bactiria

(i) Autotrophic: chemotrophic & photoautotrophic 
(ii) Hetrotrophic: parasitic, saprophytic 

Parasitic: 
	Internal 
	External 

Cholera has outer digestion and when it releases the enzymes in our intestine, it causes swelling and the intestine cannot do its work of absorbing the water. Therefore the patient becomes dehydrated which is the main cause of deaths. 


When any decomposing matter is in the process bacterial external dipestion is the reason why is becomes slippery.

â€¢ Bactirias don't perform holozoic nutrition because cell wall is not digestable for them. 


Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is a cellular process by which certain specialized cells, called phagocytes, engulf and internalize foreign particles, such as bacteria, viruses, cellular debris, or other substances

Pinocytosis: Pinocytosis, also known as "cell drinking," is a non-selective process where the cell membrane invaginates and forms tiny vesicles to internalize extracellular fluid and its contents, allowing the cell to sample and uptake various solutes present in the surrounding environment.

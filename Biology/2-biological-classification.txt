The need for classification organizes all the organisms based on the characters to make study easier. 

>>> How to classify 

Categorize based on some fixed criteria. 

Morphological features: outside physical characteristics 

R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed the Five Kingdom Classification

Euglena has both chloroplast and holozoic nutrition

Controversial microbes are placed in Protista 

Chitin - amide derivative of glucose

Tissue: a group of similar cells performing a similar task

Kingdom Monera 

They are Unicellular Prokaryotes 

The cell wall is not made of cellulose or chitin but peptidoglycan, a polymer of linked sugars and polypeptides

Monera -> archaebacteria, eubacteria 

Initially, the RNA was formed in the cell but the origins are unknown 

RNA -> DNA 
Amino acid -> protein 
	Both combined and formed protoplasm which evolved into prokaryotic cell 

India became the top in milk production -> more cattle -> more archaebacteria (methanogen) -> more methane production -> Global warming 

Archaebacteria can digest cellulose which is present in the cow's stomach. 

Organic materials that are present in ice caps are being digested by methanogenic bacteria and are forming methane. Global warming has created an issue of exposing this methane layer which will further increase global warming. 

Methane traps heat 4 times that of carbon dioxide. 

3 types of archaebacteria: 
	Halophilic: found in salt deposits
	Thermoacidophilic: hot springs and acidic environments 
	Methanogenic: produces methane from organic matter. 

A solid (capsule) or jelly-like substance (glycocalyx) protects the cell. 

The hair-like structure surrounding the cell is called flagella or cilia based on the length and function. 
	Cilia are short and cover the cell and flagella are long hair that helps in the movement 


Probiotic capsules have living spores of lactobacillus which maintain the microenvironment of our intestine. 

Curd consumers already have lactobacillus in their intestines. 

Bacteria that cause stomach ache damages the lining of the intestine which is the cause of pain and irritation.

Ribosomes, cell walls, RNA and DNA may be present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes 

Most Prokaryotes use anaerobic respiration 

All archaebacteria are anaerobic 

Excess oxygen in biogas plants makes it useless because oxygen is toxic for archaebacteria 

The plasma membrane was first studied in RBC 

Carbohydrate - Sugar - soluble in water, has a taste 
			   Non-Sugar - insoluble in water, tasteless 

Glucose, fructose - monosaccharides
Sucrose - disaccharide
Starch, dextrin, cellulose - Polysaccharide 


BSI: Botanical Survey of India 






18/05/23 

Types of bacteria based on structure: 
	Cocci, Bacilli, spirilla, vibro

Culture: taking an infected part and cultivating them for experimentation. 


>>> Protozoa

Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms that belong to the kingdom Protista. They exhibit diverse forms and play essential roles in various ecosystems, while some species can cause diseases in humans and animals.

Antibiotics should be taken daily or else the bacteria will become resistant to it. 

Superbugs are powerful bacteria resistant to antibiotics. 

Gram-positive -> get stained
Gran negative -> no staining

Gram-positive bacteria have fewer lipids and they absorb the stain and retain the color. 
	However, it's the exact opposite for Gram-negative bacteria


>>> Nutrition in bacteria

(i) Autotrophic: Chemotrophic & Photoautotrophic 
(ii) Heterotrophic: Parasitic, Saprophytic 

Parasitic: 
	Internal 
	External 

Cholera has outer digestion and when it releases the enzymes in our intestine, it causes swelling and the intestine cannot do its work of absorbing the water. Therefore the patient becomes dehydrated which is the main cause of death. 


When any decomposing matter is in the process of bacterial external digestion it becomes slippery.

• Bacteria don't perform holozoic nutrition because the cell wall is not digestible for them. 


Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is a cellular process by which certain specialized cells, called phagocytes, engulf and internalize foreign particles, such as bacteria, viruses, cellular debris, or other substances

Pinocytosis: Pinocytosis, also known as "cell drinking," is a non-selective process where the cell membrane invaginates and forms tiny vesicles to internalize extracellular fluid and its contents, allowing the cell to sample and uptake various solutes present in the surrounding environment.




Q1> What is Gram Stain? 
Q2> Distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative.



A1> Gram stain is a widely used laboratory technique in microbiology for distinguishing and categorizing bacteria into two major groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The stain involves a series of steps, including applying a purple dye (crystal violet) to the bacterial sample, adding iodine as a mordant, decolorizing with alcohol or acetone, and counterstaining with a contrasting color (such as safranin). The stain differentiates bacteria based on their cell wall composition. Gram-positive bacteria retain the purple stain, appearing purple under a microscope, while Gram-negative bacteria lose the stain and appear pink or red after counterstaining. The Gram stain is valuable in bacterial identification and provides preliminary information about the potential pathogenicity and response to certain antibiotics.

A2> Gram-positive: 
(i) Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, making up a significant portion of the cell wall structure.
(ii) During the Gram staining process, Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet dye and appear purple after decolorization.
(iii) The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is relatively simple, with peptidoglycan being the major component. It lacks an outer membrane.
(iv) Gram-positive bacteria are generally more susceptible to antibiotics that target the cell wall, such as penicillin. The thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls provides a target for these antibiotics.
(v) Many Gram-positive bacteria produce exotoxins, which are released into the surrounding environment and can cause various symptoms and diseases.

Gram-negative: 
(i) Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner layer of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, located between an outer membrane and an inner cytoplasmic membrane.
(ii) During the Gram staining process, Gram-negative bacteria lose the crystal violet dye and appear pink or red after counterstaining with safranin.
(iii) The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is more complex, consisting of an outer membrane composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and proteins, in addition to the peptidoglycan layer.
(iv) Gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane that acts as a protective barrier against certain chemicals and antibiotics. It also contains porins, which allow the passage of small molecules.
(v) Gram-negative bacteria produce endotoxins, which are components of the LPS in the outer membrane. These endotoxins can trigger immune responses and contribute to the symptoms associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.

> Bacterial reproduction

• Asexual is common. 

• Takes max 20 minutes. 

Nuclei -> cell 
	This process is called Amitosis 

• Sometimes, the cell also exhibits spore formation.	

In this process, the cell divides the nucleus within itself and the cell is bounded by the cell wall. When it is time, the cell wall bursts and releases all the spores in the surrounding medium. 


Pilus's form of reproduction

• The preliminary form of sexual reproduction in bacteria is called conjugation, where genetic material is transferred between bacterial cells through a pilus.

The F-plasmid is a circular DNA molecule found in bacteria that allows for conjugation, the transfer of genetic material. It carries genes for pilus formation and can also carry antibiotic resistance genes.

> Bacteriophage virus

Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacteria. They are the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth, estimated to outnumber bacteria by a factor of 10 to 1. Bacteriophages play a crucial role in shaping bacterial populations and influencing microbial ecosystems.

Here are some key characteristics and aspects of bacteriophages:

Structure: Bacteriophages have a complex structure consisting of a protein coat called a capsid, which encapsulates their genetic material. They can have different shapes, such as icosahedral, filamentous, or complex structures.

Genetic Material: Bacteriophages can possess either DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The genetic material carries the instructions for viral replication and the production of viral components.

Infection Process: Bacteriophages have a specific host range, meaning they can only infect certain types or species of bacteria. They use tail fibers or other specialized structures to recognize and attach to specific receptors on the bacterial cell surface. Once attached, the phage injects its genetic material into the host cell.

Replication: Inside the bacterial cell, the phage genetic material takes control of the host's cellular machinery and redirects it to produce viral components. These components are then assembled to form new bacteriophages. Eventually, the infected bacterial cell lyses (bursts open), releasing a large number of phage particles, which can go on to infect other bacteria.

Impact on Bacterial Populations: Bacteriophages are major drivers of bacterial evolution and diversity. They can exert selective pressure on bacterial populations, leading to the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria. Phages can also transfer genes between bacteria through a process called transduction, thereby contributing to horizontal gene transfer and the spread of genetic traits, including antibiotic-resistance genes.

Applications: Bacteriophages have gained attention for their potential applications in various fields. They have been explored as alternatives to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria (phage therapy). Phages are also used in molecular biology research, genetic engineering, and as tools for detecting and quantifying bacteria

Thorax: provides a base for the muscle attachment of the upper extremities, the head and neck, the vertebral column, and the pelvis. 

Spiracle: external respiratory opening with a number of holes in an insect. 

• Mesosomes and cristae help in respiration too. 
• Mesosome-having bacteria are generally gram-negative. 

• Composition of cristae and mesosome are similar 

> Theory of the origin of mitochondria in the cell 
Mitochondria originated from bacteria that were engulfed by a host cell. They formed a symbiotic relationship where the bacteria provided energy production capabilities, and the host cell offered protection. Over time, the engulfed bacteria evolved into mitochondria, losing their independence. This theory is supported by similarities in structure, reproduction, and the presence of distinct mitochondrial DNA.

• Cyanobacteria uses water to produce a single atom of oxygen and when that atom fuses with another atom, it forms oxygen gas. 

• That's why it is also purposed that chloroplast in plant cells has origins back to cyanobacteria. 

Cyanobacteria are seen to exhibit spore formation and nuclear fission

Chain-like structure in cyanobacteria is called Trichome. 

The chain has special differentiated cyanobacteria cells that help in nitrogen fixation in soil. 

• Hormogonia is a fraction of a filament in algae that detaches from the organism and reproduces by cell division. 

When the nostoc (blue-green algae) colony wants to expand, it fragments a part of itself away and that part is called Hormogonia. 



Anabaena azollae 
	Anabaena azollae is a cyanobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with the water fern Azolla. It helps the fern by fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere, enabling Azolla to thrive in nitrogen-deficient environments. This symbiosis is beneficial in agriculture and environmental research as a natural nitrogen fertilizer and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.


• Cyanobacteria is present in the leaves living in a symbiotic relationship. 

• Nostoc is also found in the roots of some plants.

Negatives: 
	1. Medical emergencies (accidents by slipping on it)
	2. Poison formation in aquatic bodies. 



Phylogenetic relationship: classification based on evolutionary relationship with the ancestors. 

Acidophile example: Thermus aquaticus 

Cyanobacteria despite being called blue-green algae is kept in monera because it is a prokaryotic cell.

Mycoplasma is the smallest cell in the world.

• It is also called PPLO which stands for Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms.
	Since it is found in the pleural fluid (a liquid that is located between the layers of the pleura, i.e., a thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest cavity) of cows suffering from pneumonia

It also causes diseases in plants called witch's broom infection.

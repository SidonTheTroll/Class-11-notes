# Locomotion and Movement 

**Movement**: displacement is zero but activities are done.  
**Locomotion**: displacement is present.

- Both depend on the muscular system 

Brain gives signals to nerves and it contracts and relaxes the muscles. 

# Muscle 

- Originates from mesoderm 
    - Mesoderm forms bones and muscles. 

<br>

- Muscle types 
    - Skeletal (striated)
    - Visceral (Smooth)
    - Cardiac 

> Only striated muscles are required for movement and locomotion. (so, they are called voluntary muscles)

- Has some dark and light bands. 
- One muscle fiber has collection of all muscle bundles.
- The connective tissue that surrounds the muscle fibers is called **fascia**. 
- Sarcolemma is the cell membrane surrounding the skeletal muscle fiber or cardiomyocyte. 
    - Sarco means related to **muscles**
    - Similarly, muscle cytoplasm will be called sarcoplasm
- Maximum calcium is in sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
- Calcium plays a key role in muscle contraction. 

Actin filament: thin  
Myosin filament: thick 

- Trypomyosin thread (generally 2) binds actin together. 
- Tryponin function: block myosin from attatching unnecessarily. 

<br> 

- Sarcoplasm is coenocytic 
- sarcoplasmic reticulum stores most of the Calcium 

Light band contains actin and is called **light band or isotropic band**  
And dark band contains myosin and called **dark band or anisotropic band**  
A Z-line bisects in the center of each **I-band**

A region called **H-band** (H for homogenous) is found in the **middle of A-band** and is required to provide space for the **parallel movement of actin and myosin**

## Myosin 

- Parts: 
    - Head 
    - Arm 
        - Both head and arm forms myosin head
    - Tail 

ATP binding sites have ATP and function as transfer. 

## Mucsle Contraction - Sliding Filament Theory 

On signal, protein structure changes and activates actin and myosin filaments and tropomyosin gets detatched and calcium ion is relased and forms extra substance and ATP excites myosin and myosin and actin get attatched. 

In this activity, actin and myosin slide over each other, therefore, it is called **Sliding filament theory**.

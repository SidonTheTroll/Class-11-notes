# Locomotion and Movement 

**Movement**: displacement is zero but activities are done.  
**Locomotion**: displacement is present.

- Both depend on the muscular system 

Brain gives signals to nerves and it contracts and relaxes the muscles. 

# Muscle 

- Originates from mesoderm 
    - Mesoderm forms bones and muscles. 

<br>

- Muscle types 
    - Skeletal/striated 
    - Smooth 
    - Cardiac 

> Only striated muscles are required for movement and locomotion. (so, they are called voluntary muscles)

- Has some dark and light bands. 
- One muscle fiber has collection of all muscle bundles.
- The connective tissue that surrounds the muscle fibers is called **fascia**. 
- Sarcolemma is the cell membrane surrounding the skeletal muscle fiber or cardiomyocyte. 
    - Sarco means related to **muscles**
    - Similarly, muscle cytoplasm will be called sarcoplasm
- Maximum calcium is in sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
- Calcium plays a key role in muscle contraction. 

Actin filament: thin  
Myosin filament: thick 

- Trypomyosin thread (generally 2) binds actin together. 
- Tryponin function: block myosin from attatching unnecessarily. 

## Myosin 

- Parts: 
    - Head 
    - Arm 
        - Both head and arm forms myosin head
    - Tail 

ATP binding sites have ATP and function as transfer.

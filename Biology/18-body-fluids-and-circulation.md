Insects have open circulatory system.  
Pisces and animalia have closed circulatory system. 

**Artery**: vessels carrying blood from heart to other parts.  
**Vein**: vessels carrying blood from other parts to the heart.

**Pulmonary**: not the regular but opposite 

Right ventricle is for impure blood and is sent to the lungs 

Left part of heart: pure blood  
Right part of heart: impure blood 

## Systemic Circulation

The largest part of aorta goes to down the body and the other 3 arteries go to the brain, limbs, etc. 

Inferior vena cava: from lower half  
Superior vena cava: from upper half  

- There are 2 more types: 
    - Renal (kidney) system 
    - Hepatic (liver) system

- Types of valves in the heart 
    - Aortic Valve
    - Mitral Valve
    - Pulmonary Valve 
    - Tricuspid valve

Ventricular part of the heart has more thickness because it has to give more pressure to pump the blood from the heart. 

**Peri-cardium membrane covers the heart.**

Just after 4th week, the fetus's heart starts beating.  
So consider a person who lived exactly 100 years, then the person's heart has beaten for exactly for 100 years and 8 months. 

Sound is produced by the heart because of the contraction and relaxation. A little gap between the beat ensures that it beats for the rest of the life.  
Firts the atrium contracts and relaxes then the same for the ventricle but with an interval. In that time, the interval is enough to conserve energy. 

The texture of the heart and liver are different from the muscles because of the compositon of different cells.

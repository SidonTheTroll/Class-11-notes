Insects have open circulatory system.  
Pisces and animalia have closed circulatory system. 

**Artery**: vessels carrying blood from heart to other parts.  
**Vein**: vessels carrying blood from other parts to the heart.

**Pulmonary**: not the regular but opposite 

Right ventricle is for impure blood and is sent to the lungs 

Left part of heart: pure blood  
Right part of heart: impure blood 

## Systemic Circulation

The largest part of aorta goes to down the body and the other 3 arteries go to the brain, limbs, etc. 

Inferior vena cava: from lower half  
Superior vena cava: from upper half  

- There are 2 more types: 
    - Renal (kidney) system 
    - Hepatic (liver) system 

<br> 

- Types of valves in the heart 
    - Aortic Valve
    - Mitral Valve
    - Pulmonary Valve 
    - Tricuspid valve

Ventricular part of the heart has more thickness because it has to give more pressure to pump the blood from the heart. 

**Peri-cardium membrane covers the heart.**

Just after 4th week, the fetus's heart starts beating.  
So consider a person who lived exactly 100 years, then the person's heart has beaten for exactly for 100 years and 8 months. 

Sound is produced by the heart because of the contraction and relaxation. A little gap between the beat ensures that it beats for the rest of the life.  
Firts the atrium contracts and relaxes then the same for the ventricle but with an interval. In that time, the interval is enough to conserve energy. 

The texture of the heart and liver are different from the muscles because of the compositon of different cells.

0.8 second rest is taken by the heart between contraction and relaxation. 

1 minute of blood circulation sends 5 liters of blood. 

Heart rate is about 70-72 per minute in a healthy adult. 

Doctors check the pulse by touching the wrist or neck. 

Children have higher pulse and old people have lower. 

Athletes have a larger heart to pump more blood but its not good for a normal person. 

Pacemakes is a small device which sends electric impulses to make the heart function. 

SA (sinoatrial) node is the place which initiates the pulse in the heart and then carries it to AV (atrioventricular) node. 

**Bundle of His** is an elongated segment connecting the AV Node and the left and right bundle branches of the septal crest. It is approximately 1.8 cm long in an adult heart and is primarily located deep within the dense connective tissue.  
**Purkinje fibres** are connected to Bundle of his and helps to carry the impulse through the heart. 

## ECG (ElectroCardioGram)

It is a graph which shows the rate of heart of an individual generally on a screen to help the doctors during operation. 

## Cholesterol 

Good cholesterol is present under the skin and helps to produce Vitamin-D in the presence of sunlight. 

- Types of UV rays 
    - UVa: Converts cholesterol to ergosterol which produces Vitamin-D which helps in the production of calcium and provide immunity. 
    - UVb: Damages DNA, causes sunburn and causes cancer. 
    - UVc: Causes cancer and cataract. 

**Note:** artificial lights don't produce Vitamin-D

Body cannot utilize calcium without sufficient Vitamin-D. 

Folic acid help in the absorption of Vitamin-D and iron. 

Food from the locality helps to gain immunity because of the same chemicals in the environment. 

Carbon handprint is the opposite of footprint which means the reduction of carbon emissions by an individual.  
This can be done partly by consuming local products instead of importing it from other countries. 

**Bad cholesterol** is present in the inner lining of the artery and reduces the blood flow and makes the heart pump harder which results in paint and eventually leads to heart attack. 

In case of emergencies, certain tablets are used on the patient to increase the size to arteries and give come time to the doctor to initiate the surgery. 

- Common surgeries include:
    - **Coronary angioplasty**: tiny balloon on a narrow tube, called a catheter, is used to widen a clogged artery and improve blood flow. 
    - **Bypass surgery**: an artery from other part is taken out and fixed in the blocked artery to make a by-pass for the blood to flow smoothly. 

To prevent bad cholesterol, deep fried and salty food must be avoided. 

Chemically refined oil also creates saturated fatty acid in the body and induces bad cholesterol production. Palm oil is equally harmful. 

Coconut, groundnut, sunflower, olive, mustard oil are healthy oils for cooking. 

Omega 3 fatty acid (fish oil) reduces cholesterol deposition in the body. 

Microplastics have also become harmful for the heart because it can't be escaped in modern world. 

## Heart Disorders 

1. **High blood pressure/Hypertension**: Cholesterol, sodium increase the pressure on heart. In access sugar, it converts into fat; first deposits in the skin and then in arteries.

2. **Coronary Artery Disease**: also known as **atherosclerosis**, affects vlood supplying vessels to the heart muscle due to the deposition of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissues which makes the lumen narrower. 

3. **Angina**: also known as **angina pectoris**, is an acute chest pain occured when insufficient $O_2$ reaches the heart muscle. Mainly seen in men and women of middle age and elderly caused due to conditions that affect blood flow. 

4. **Heart failure**: means the state when heart is not able to pump blood effectively to need body standards. Sometimes called **congestive heart failure** because congestion of lungs is one of the major symptom. **Note that this is not the same as cardiac arrest (heart stops beating) or heart attack (heart muscle is suddenly damaged by inadequate blood supply).**

The hunan zygote contains 46 chromosomes. 

Cell division: 
Karyokinesis 
Cytokinesis 

2n = diploid 
n = haploid

• There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human body. 

Homologous chromosome: identical function and structure. 
    (If a chromosome has the sequence a,b,c,d; then its pair will be either a,b,c,d or A,B,C,D (inverse homologous))

> Diploid and Haploid 

Haploids are arranged in 1 set 
Diploids are arranged in 2 set 

Human = 2 set arrangement 
Germ cell: 1 set arrangement (helps to maintain the number of chromosomes in the human body) 


• 23rd pair is not homologous because it is the sex chromosome. Similar chromosome results in female and different chromosome results in male. 

• Cells need raw material to replicate. 

• In order to make a new cell, the old cell has to make new DNA and organelles. 



Mitosis 

Original cell = 2n = 46 chromosomes 
    2 Daughter cell = 2n = 46 chromosomes 



Meiosis 

Original cell = 2n = 46
    2 middle cell = n = 23 
        4 daughter cells = n = 23 

Mitosis also happens in a haploid cell 
    But haploid cells cannot involve in meiosis. 

• Cell division will not occur if the chromosomes are not even in number.

> Interphase 

M-Phase: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase, Cytokinesis

G1 Phase: The cells are metabolically active and continue to grow but do not replicate DNA. 

S-Phase: During this phase, DNA synthesis or replication takes place. The amount of DNA per cell doubles but the number of chromosomes remains the same. 

G2 Phase: Proteins are synthesized in preparation for mitosis while the cell continues to grow.

# Humans 

Physical and mental weakness leads to sleep walking. 

- Body temperature above 103 degree Fahrenheit is considered high fever
    - This leads to hallucinations 


Rh- rhesus factor 
    The Rh factor is an inherited protein that can be found on the surface of the red blood cell. If your blood type is positive, then your blood cells have the Rh protein.

Male blood positive and female blood negative hinders the development of the fetus. 


# Animal Kingdom

Liver fluke spreads by fragmentation 

> Tapeworm has pieces and adult tapeworm fragments and spreads the eggs wherever it falls. 

Liver fluke also spreads by excreta  
Has hooks and sucker  
Alimentary system is incomplete (anus is absent) 

Osmoregulation is maintained by **flame cells**  
Sexes are nonseparate (hermaphrodite)  
Has indirect development.  
Planaria has high regeneration ability.  
Bilaterally symmetrical  
Triploblastic and acoelomate  

- Humans are coelomate 
- Has organ level organization 
- Dorso-ventrally flattened body

Male seahorse doesn't give birth. The female lays eggs in its pouch and the male incubates them.

**Gizzard**: The gizzard is an oval, muscular, and thick-walled structural organ with teeth that helps to grind the food.
Thorax: provides a base for the muscle attachment of the upper extremities, the head and neck, the vertebral column, and the pelvis.

**Spiracle**: external respiratory opening with a number of holes in an insect.

**Serendipity**: suddenly finding or discovering something.

> Male frog shouts to call for female for mating.

# Plants 

No algae is found after the depth of 500 m because of the lack of light. 

**Monosaccharides**: sweet and water soluble 

2-10: polygosaccharide
+10 unit: Polysaccharide

More Chlorophyll = More energy trapped 

If plants are in shady area, to capture more energy, the increase their surface area. 

High amounts of solar energy is harmful to plants because it deforms the proteins in it. 

## PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation):

- PAR is the part of sunlight that plant cells are best at capturing for photosynthesis.
- It consists of light in the wavelength range of approximately 400 to 700 nanometers.
- This is the "energy range" of sunlight that plants use to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars and oxygen through photosynthesis.
- PAR is like the perfect recipe of light for plants, providing the energy they need to thrive and grow.

# Circulatory System 

## Fainting while Standing 

While standing for a long time, the blood is redirected into the legs instead of brain for being stable. But prolonged stillness reduces the minimal amount of blood required for the brain to be active. That's why a person faints while standing for long time without any activity. 

This can be prevented by periodically doing some activity to improve the circulation. If the situation says otherwise, then move the toes inside the shoes.

# Cancer, Drugs and Intoxication 

Cancer is caused by the oncogene which is in inactive form which is called Proto-oncogene. It requires them to be activated to cause cancer. 

Proto-oncogene gets transformed to oncogene by the result of nicotine found in vapes, cigerrates, tobacco, cigars, gutka, etc. This affects the lungs, mouth, throat and lungs. 

Treatment includes chemotherapy at the cheapest and more expensive yet more effective treatments include stem cell transplant, radiation therapy, etc. 

Carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas for human beings. Its concentration of 600 ppm induces coma; increase to 800 ppm results in death. 

MSG, Nicotine and food coloring should be avoided at all costs because they release dopamine and the person wants more of it. After a long time of consumpion, this results in cancer, diabetes and other diseases. 

Second hand smoking is as harmful as first hand smoking because it passively affects the person even if they have never smoked. 

Drugs can't be detected from blood most of the time. So that's why tests are usually done by urine because the kidneys filter the blood and there's a concentration of the drug in the blood that can be easily detected.

# Body Heat 

Every warm blooded organism released body heat to the surrounding via infrared radiation. 

That's how IR cameras work.

# Kidney Function 

The fetus development requires calcium to make the bones and frequent pregnencies can reduce the bone density of the mother. 

More hormones are produced during pregnancy and this is also found in the urine. Therefore, the urine is tested to detect pregnancy.

Sufficient water can decrease cell aging and wrinkles. Also with reduced carbohydrates.

# 1. 20/06/23

Carl Linnaeus started studying plants based on mode of reproduction by flowers.

Bentham and Hooker divided Plant Kingdom into two divisions: Cryptogamia (non-flowering plants) and Phanerogamia (flowering plants)

Plants were first classified based on the morphology and anatomy and then later classified based evolutionary relationship called Phylogenetic relationship.

Chemotaxonomy: clasisfication based on chemicals present.
Cytotaxonomy: classified based on cell features
Numerical taxonomy: clasisfication with the help of computers

### 4.0.1. Q1/ Describe the pigmentation in algae.

- There are three types of algae, i.e., Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and rhodophyceae. They have their own pigments which carry out functions in their cells.
- **Chlorophyceae (green algae):** As by the name, it is obvious that his algae has chlorophyll as its major pigment which carry out photosynthesis. Namely, those are chlorophyll a and b which help to produce the organism's food as well as reserves.
- **Phaeophyceae (brown algae):** These algae have the fucoxanthin as its main pigment as well as chlorophyll a and c to help in photosynthesis.

- **Rhodophyceae (red algae):** These algae are red in color and have phycoerythrin as its main pigment but also has chlorophyll a and d to supplement in its photosynthesis.

### 4.0.2. Q/ Discuss the reserve food material present in algae.

- Chlorophyceae has startch as their reserves which is a proof that it primaily uses chlorophyll to produce food.
  - Phaeophyceae have mannitol and laminarin which are the products of stored complex carbohydrates.
- Rhodophycae have floridean starch as its reserves which is the mixture of carbohydrates which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.

### 4.0.3. Q/ Mention the economic importance of algae

- The Economic importance of algae are as follows:
  - Species of porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are used as food.
  - Certain Rhodophyceae and Phaeophyceae in water bodies produce oxygen and in large amounts if they are in ocean.
  - Agar, an important commercial product used in microbial culture and production of ice-cream and jellies is derived from Gelidium and Gracilaria.
  - Chlorella is a source of protein dnad is used to make protein supplements for consumption even by astronauts.
  - Many species of algae usually interfere in agriculture and their overconcentration causes the formation of algal blooms.

### 4.0.4. Q/ Describe the reproduction in algae.

- Algae reproduce through fragmentation, where a piece of the parent algae breaks off and grows into a new individual.
- Asexual spores are also a common means of reproduction in algae. They are produced by algae, forming identical daughter cells that can disperse and develop into new organisms.
- Some algae undergo sexual reproduction. Specialized structures produce haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization, forming diploid zygotes. These zygotes then develop into new multicellular algae.

<br>

## 5.1. Bryophyta

- Similar root, leaves and stem like structures like in higher plants.
  - They are not true because they lack vascular bundle.

<br>

- Has single cell and multicell structures.
- Bryophyte is the **only amphibian group in plant Kingdom**.

**Amphibian:** initial part started in water but ended life on land. Eg: frog, dragonfly, etc.

`Male frog shouts to call for female for mating.`

- Amphibians go through metamorphosis
  - **Metamorphosis:** complete change

```
Indirect development: young one is different from the adult
Direct development: young one is similar to the adult.
```

- Bryophyta needs water for reproduction.

## 9.1. Fern

Plant body (sporophyte) is prominent  
Gametophyte is prominent in bryophyte

Big spores are female; small spores are male  
These are called heterospore

Higher plants are descendant of ptridophyte  
Since, it has spores for reproduction.

Ovary -> fruit  
Ovule -> seed

Heterosporic condition is the start of seed forming.  
Heterosporic is the precursor to seed habit.

Seed habit: mode of sexual reproduction

Archegonia = egg bearing structure (female character)

After the fern zygote matures, it transforms into a structure called Protonema which grows into fern.

The gametes fall to the ground and forms a zygote that further grows to form protonema

Embryophytic evolution: Embyophytic evolution is the process where plants evolved from water to land, developing features like embryos, roots, and protective layers to survive on land.

Osmunda fern is found in Elephants waterwalls and the whorl of leaves is similar to that of flower but isn't.

Carl Linnaeus started studying plants based on mode of reproduction by flowers. 

Bentham and Hooker divided Plant Kingdom into two divisions: Cryptogamia (non-flowering plants) and Phanerogamia (flowering plants)

Plants were first classified based on the morphology and anatomy and then later classified based evolutionary relationship called Phylogenetic relationship. 

Chemotaxonomy: clasisfication based on chemicals present.
Cytotaxonomy: classified based on cell features 
Numerical taxonomy: clasisfication with the help of computers

Fungus: chitin, heterotroph
Algae: cellulose, autotroph 

Algae generally requires water to survive

- Algae: 
    - Green Algae (Chlorophyta)
    - Red Algae (Rhodophyta)
    - Brown Algae (Phaeophyta)
    - Diatoms (Bacillariophyta)
    - Dinoflagellates (Dinophyta)
    - Euglenophytes (Euglenophyta)
    - Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria)

![Volvox](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Mikrofoto.de-volvox-4.jpg)

Colony of Chlamydomonas forms a piliminary organism but its not multicellular because every cell is independent and eventually forms a volvox 

- Volvox is almost multicellular because it has some specialized cells and lives in colonies. 

All chlophyll having algae are green but the form of chlorophyll is different. 


- Importance of algae: 
    - Food and Nutritional Supplements
    - Aquaculture and Animal Feed
    - Biofuel Production
    - Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology

```

- Algae belongs to thallophyta 
    - Thallos in latin means green shoot, young branch, twig

<br>

- Study of algae is called phycology 

```
Father of phycology: F. E. Fritsch

```

- Basis of algal classification: 
    - Pigment composition and body color 
    - Nature and composition of reserved food materials 
    - Flagellation 

<br>

- Rhodophycae is found in warm regions 
    - It can also survive in shallow and deep waters 
    - Floridean starch is reserved. 
        - Similar to amylopectin and glycogen.

- **Laminaria:** Reserved food is called laminarin reserves

## Divisions of algae

### Chlorophyta

- Similarities:
  - Habitat: Found in various aquatic environments, including freshwater and marine habitats.
  - Pigment: Contain chlorophyll a and b, giving them a green color.
  - Reproduction: Can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

<br>

- Differences:
    - Pigment Reserve: Store excess energy as starch.
    - Flagellation: Typically possess two flagella per cell.
   
### Phaeophyta
- Similarities:
    - Habitat: Primarily found in marine environments, especially in colder waters.
    - Reproduction: Reproduce both sexually and asexually.

<br>

- Differences:
    - Pigment: Contain chlorophyll a and c, fucoxanthin, which gives them a brown   color.
    - Pigment Reserve: Store excess energy as laminarin and mannitol.
    - Flagellation: Usually lack flagella.
### Rhodophyta
- Similarities:
    - Habitat: Predominantly found in marine environments, ranging from shallow to deep waters.
    - Pigment: Contain chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrin, giving them a red color.
    - Reproduction: Exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction.

<br>

- Differences:
    - Pigment Reserve: Store excess energy as floridean starch.
    - Flagellation: Lacks flagella.

### Q1/ Describe the pigmentation in algae. 
- There are three types of algae, i.e., Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and rhodophyceae. They have their own pigments which carry out functions in their cells. 
- **Chlorophyceae (green algae):** As by the name, it is obvious that his algae has chlorophyll as its major pigment which carry out photosynthesis. Namely, those  are chlorophyll a and b which help to produce the organism's food as well as reserves. 
- **Phaeophyceae (brown algae):** These algae have the fucoxanthin as its main pigment as well as chlorophyll a and c to help in photosynthesis. 

- **Rhodophyceae (red algae):** These algae are red in color and have phycoerythrin as its main pigment but also has chlorophyll a and d to supplement in its photosynthesis. 

### Q/ Discuss the reserve food material present in algae. 

- Chlorophyceae has startch as their reserves which is a proof that it primaily uses chlorophyll to produce food. 
  - Phaeophyceae have mannitol and laminarin which are the products of stored complex carbohydrates. 
- Rhodophycae have floridean starch as its reserves which is the mixture of carbohydrates which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure. 

### Q/ Mention the economic importance of algae 

- The Economic importance of algae are as follows: 
  - Species of porphyra, Laminaria and Sargassum are used as food. 
  - Certain Rhodophyceae and Phaeophyceae in water bodies produce oxygen and in large amounts if they are in ocean. 
  - Agar, an important commercial product used in microbial culture and production of ice-cream and jellies is derived from Gelidium and Gracilaria. 
  - Chlorella is a source of protein dnad is used to make protein supplements for consumption even by astronauts.
  - Many species of algae usually interfere in agriculture and their overconcentration causes the formation of algal blooms. 

### Q/ Describe the reproduction in algae. 
- Algae reproduce through fragmentation, where a piece of the parent algae breaks off and grows into a new individual.
- Asexual spores are also a common means of reproduction in algae. They are produced by algae, forming identical daughter cells that can disperse and develop into new organisms.
- Some algae undergo sexual reproduction. Specialized structures produce haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization, forming diploid zygotes. These zygotes then develop into new multicellular algae.

- Laminaria can grow more than 100 m below seabed.

## Bryophyta



- Similar root, leaves and stem like structures like in higher plants. 
    - They are not true because they lack vascular bundle.

<br>

- Has single cell and multicell structures. 
- Bryophyte is the **only amphibian group in plant Kingdom**. 

**Amphibian:** initial part started in water but ended life on land. Eg: frog, dragonfly, etc. 

`Male frog shouts to call for female for mating.`

- Amphibians go through metamorphosis
  - **Metamorphosis:** complete change 

```
Indirect development: young one is different from the adult
Direct development: young one is similar to the adult. 
```
- Bryophyta needs water for reproduction. 

## Bryophyta offsprings

### After the two gametes fuse

<img align=centre src='https://i.imgur.com/XW5tEsv.png' width=350>

## Moss

<img align= right src="diagrams/moss.jpeg" alt="moss" width="300" />

- **Sporophyte:** Diploid 
- **Gametophyte:** Haploid

- Protonema is found in the sporophyte section and is diploid.

- Features
    - They are non-vascular
    - Small in size 
    - Anchor themselves by rhyzoids
    - Needs moisture for reproduction 
    - Reproduces by spores 
    - Found in forests, wetlands, bogs, rocks and damp urban areas. 

<br>
<br>

## Liverwort

- Comes under Bryophyte 
- Reproduction same as moss and Bryophyte

### Gemmae 
<img align='right' src="diagrams/gemmae.png" width=400>


Asexual reproduction takes place through fragmentation of thalli by the production of gemmae. 

- Gemmae are green, multicellular and asexual spores. 

- Economic importance
  - Helps in formation of forests 

- Crustose lichen grows on rocks

Humus: dead and decaying matter that helps in plant formation.

- Bryophyte is found in damp and shady areas. 
<img src='diagrams/liverwort.png' width=200 align=right alt=liverwort>

- Moss grows in damp areas and walls. 


- Liverwort is found in soil. 

- Under suitable conditions, moss can make a carpet on surfaces like on trees and floor. 
<img src='diagrams/mature-moss.png' align=right width=300>

- Peat is formed when biomass (moss and trees) are buried in soil. 

- Moss and other bryophyte spores can survive and again germinate in moist conditions. 

- *Tinospora cordifolia* (heart-leaved moonseed/giloy) has chlorophyll in its roots.

# Meristematic Tissue 

These are the tissues that have the power to divide. 

- Types
  - Apical meristem 
  - Intercalary meristem 
  - Lateral meristem 

These tissuse are classified based on their location. 

From meristematic tissues, permanent tissues are fromed from differentiation.   
But under some conditions, the dedifferentiate

### Apical Meristem 

Found in tips of shoot and roots. 

### Intercalary Meristem 

Found in base of leaves and inter-nodal segment. 

> Leaves only come out of nodes.

### Lateral Meristem

These are found in mature parts of the plant, eg- the girth of the tree

These are also called **cambium** or **vascular cambium** 

Note that monocot plants don't have vascular cambium

> Increase in girth is also called secondary growth.

Generally,  
Inside growth: xylem  
Outside growth: phloem

Therefore, the furnitures that are eaten by termite have phloem present in it. So the furniture that are made from 50-60 year old trees are better suitable for furniture because they have xylem.  
Since phloem transports food, termites eat it and xylem only carries water and minerals. 

# Permanent Tissues 

These cells don't have the ability to divide further. 

- **Types** 
  - **Simple**: All cells are similar in structure 
  - **Complex**: there are different types of cells

## Simple Permanent Tissues 

These are similar in structure and provide support, protection as well as photosynthesis and assist in conduction of water, minerals and nutrients.

### Parenchyma 

Parenchyma forms the major components within organs. 

- **Shape**:  These cells are generally rough spherical or polyhedral and may have elongation. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose and these are packed closely or have small intercellular spaces.

- **Functions**: These cells perform various functions such as photosynthesis, storage and secretion. 

- **Location**: Found in the cortex of stems and roots, mesophyll in leaves, and pulp of fruits.

### Collenchyma 

- **Shape**: Consists of cells which are thickened in the corners due to deposition of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. These may be oval, spherical or polygonal. Intercellular space is absent. 

- **Functions**: These provide mechanical strength to young and growing parts of the plant and are involved in maintaining structural integrity of the plant. These cells assimilate food when they contain photosynthesis and they are called **chlorenchyma**. 

- **Location**: Found in layers belor epidermis in most dicotyledonous plants either as a homogeneous layer or in patches. These are also present in growing parts of the plant such as a young stem and a petiole of a leaf. 

### Sclerenchyma 

- **Shape**: Sclerenchyma cells are characterized by their long, narrow shape, thick lignified cell walls, and the presence of few or numerous pits. Typically dead and lacking protoplasts, they exist as either fibers or sclereids, which vary in structure, origin, and development. Fibers are elongated, pointed cells occurring in groups, while sclereids, found in various plant parts, are spherical, oval, or cylindrical with highly thickened walls and narrow lumens.

- **Functions**: these provide mechanical support to organs and help protect seeds.

- **Location**: these are commonly found in the mature regions of stems, fruit walls of nuts, pult of fruits like guava, pear and sapota, seed coats of legumes and tea leaves. 

# Types of Wood 

- **Hard Wood**: obtained from dicot trees found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests.  
- **Sap wood**: aka alburnum, these are outer living layers of trees which engage in transport of water and minerals to the crown of the tree.
- **Spring wood**: at summer and spring, the cambium is actively producing wood and these help to transport water and minerals therefore, have larger xylem element.   
- **Annual wood**: these are formed during winter and autumn season when water is scarce and results in narrow xylem vessels therefore making the wood dense. 

Annual ring: it is a ring that forms annually in the girth of the tree as a result of growth. 

# Xylem and Phloem 

## Xylem 

- Parts 
  - Tracheids
  - Vessels
  - Xylem Parenchyma
  - Xylem fibers

## Phloem 

- Parts 
  - Companion cells
  - Sieve tubes
  - Phloem parenchyma
  - Phloem fibers

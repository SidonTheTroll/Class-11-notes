Morphology: physical characteristics/ external observable features 

Roots: 

![seed diagram](https://shorturl.at/chiCU)

Types of root: taproot, fibrous, adventitious root

![root types](https://shorturl.at/nsIJZ)

Adventitious root don't develop from the seed's radicle 


>>> Crop root 

Develops from radicle: taproot and fibrous root 
Doesn't develop from radicle (other than radicle): adventitious root

Fibrous root: monocot 
Taproot: dicot 


3/7/23 

Primary root persistant - taproot 
Primary root replaced - fibious root 
Other than orrt - adventitious root 

>>> Regions of Root 

![root diagram & bryophylum](https://i.imgur.com/oQCYpe0.jpg)

Asparagus, raddish, carrot, sweet potato have modified root for storage of food.

Epiphyte: a plants that grows on another plant, especially one that is not parasitic but only relies on support. Eg- orchid.

>>> Stem 

• Develops from plumule
• Ascending part 
• Always negatively geotrophic and positive phototropism 

Important part: Node, Internode 

![bamboo](https://i.imgur.com/fTeCgnG.jpg)

• Palm trees and bamboo have prominent nodes and internodes 
• For development of leaves and root, nodal portion is required. 
• One nodal and internodal portion inside soil and another outside. 

Functions: 
    Support 
    Photosynthesis 
    Vegetative propogation
    Transport
    Storage 
    Lateral growth 
    Defence 
    Climbing and support structures 

![stem and tendril](https://i.imgur.com/Er39jAZ.jpg)

Bougainvillea: 
    Flower is paper-like
    Stem has thorns 

Potato is modified stem inside the soil.

• Water hyacinth is also known as Terror of Bengal 
• Water hyacinth is an exotic plant; now an invasive species
• Reproduces by modified stem called offset which fragments away. 

Consequences: 
    Rapid growth of hyacinth 
    Habitat alteration 
    Decreased biodiversity 
    Impaired waterways 
    Clogged water intakes 
    Water stegnation

>>> Leaf

Leaves are developed from leaf primordia (appendages from the stem)

![leaf diagram](https://i.imgur.com/8ZAZjj5.jpg)

• Citronella leaf is sharp, i.e., example of leaf modification

Functions: 
    Photosynthesis
    Gas exchange
    Transpiration
    Storage
    Protection
    Shade and insulation
    Attracting pollinators
    Environmental indicators

Dorsal - upper - chloroplast
Ventral - lower - stomata 

Mesophyll cell: 
    Spongy mesophyle 
    Palisade mesophyll

Types of leaves 
    Simple
    Compound 

![simple and compound leaf](https://i.imgur.com/5GPNdDU.jpg)

• Venation - network of veins

> Types of Venation:
    Reticulate 
    Parallel 

![banana leaf and maple leaf diagram](https://i.imgur.com/h56RGNu.jpg)

Monocot has parallel venation 
Dicot has reticulate venation 

Monocot - not woody 
Dicot - woody 

> Woody means the stem that shows the growth of xylem and phloem, i.e., the secondary growth of the plant. 

Vascular bundle: xylem and phloem. 

Inside: xylem; outside: phloem

Pinnately Compound leaf: A leaf which is divided into smaller leaflets, those leaflets arranged on each side of the leaf's central stalk/rachis (axis).
Palmately Compound leaf: A palmately compound leaf has its leaflets radiating outwards from the end of the petiole, like fingers off the palm of a hand.

>>> Phyllotaxy

Types:
    Alternate
    Opposite
    Whorled 

![alternate, opposite and whroled leaf](https://i.imgur.com/EQKS7zf.jpg)

Pitcher plant has modified leaf in the form of a pitcher. 

Petiole: a slender stem that supports the blade of a foliage leaf
    > Petiole gets flattened and forms a leaf. 
    Eg- australian acacia

Morphology: physical characteristics/ external observable features 

Roots: 

![seed diagram](https://shorturl.at/chiCU)

Types of root: taproot, fibrous, adventitious root

![root types](https://shorturl.at/nsIJZ)

Adventitious root don't develop from the seed's radicle 


>>> Crop root 

Develops from radicle: taproot and fibrous root 
Doesn't develop from radicle (other than radicle): adventitious root

Fibrous root: monocot 
Taproot: dicot

Primary root persistant - taproot 
Primary root replaced - fibious root 
Other than orrt - adventitious root 

>>> Regions of Root

Asparagus, raddish, carrot, sweet potato have modified root for storage of food.

Epiphyte: a plants that grows on another plant, especially one that is not parasitic but only relies on support. Eg- orchid.

>>> Stem 

• Develops from plumule
• Ascending part 
• Always negatively geotrophic and positive phototropism 

Important part: Node, Internode

• Palm trees and bamboo have prominent nodes and internodes 
• For development of leaves and root, nodal portion is required. 
• One nodal and internodal portion inside soil and another outside. 

Functions: 
    Support 
    Photosynthesis 
    Vegetative propogation
    Transport
    Storage 
    Lateral growth 
    Defence 
    Climbing and support structures

Bougainvillea: 
    Flower is paper-like
    Stem has thorns 

Potato is modified stem inside the soil.

• Water hyacinth is also known as Terror of Bengal 
• Water hyacinth is an exotic plant; now an invasive species
• Reproduces by modified stem called offset which fragments away. 

Consequences: 
    Rapid growth of hyacinth 
    Habitat alteration 
    Decreased biodiversity 
    Impaired waterways 
    Clogged water intakes 
    Water stegnation

The air we breathe has around $21%$ oxygen and $0.03%$ Carbondioxide. 

Carbondioxide is released by the lungs after getting it from the blood. 

Glucose + Oxygen $\rightarrow$ Carbondioxide + Water + Energy 

Carbohydrate is obtained from food and is transformed to glucose during digestion. 

- Diaphragm is involved in the sucking and releasing of air in and out of the lungs. 
    - By creating areas of low and high air pressure. 

> **Rhinovirus** infects either nasal or neck passage. 

## Epiglotis function

Unwanted particles may go to the wind pipe and it causes the lungs to release the residue air to prevent damage. 

- Sugar syrup causes the epiglotis to swell and it may temporarly stop functioning. 

> Lime + Nicotin $\rightarrow$ volatile complex of $CaCO_3$ 
> 
> This causes the nerve ending to not work and it causes relaxation sensation.

- Cartilate in trachea precents it from collapsing under pressure. 

> **Pleura**: it is a serous membrane that folds back on itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac in the lungs.

The air we breathe has around $21%$ oxygen and $0.03%$ Carbondioxide. 

Carbondioxide is released by the lungs after getting it from the blood. 

Glucose + Oxygen $\rightarrow$ Carbondioxide + Water + Energy 

Carbohydrate is obtained from food and is transformed to glucose during digestion. 

- Diaphragm is involved in the sucking and releasing of air in and out of the lungs. 
    - By creating areas of low and high air pressure. 

> **Rhinovirus** infects either nasal or neck passage. 

## Epiglotis function

Unwanted particles may go to the wind pipe and it causes the lungs to release the residue air to prevent damage. 

- Sugar syrup causes the epiglotis to swell and it may temporarly stop functioning. 

> Lime + Nicotin $\rightarrow$ volatile complex of $CaCO_3$ 
> 
> This causes the nerve ending to not work and it causes relaxation sensation.

- Cartilate in trachea precents it from collapsing under pressure. 

> **Pleura**: it is a serous membrane that folds back on itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac in the lungs.

## Steps in Respiration 

1. Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air is drawn in and $CO_2$ rich alveolar air is released out. 
2. Diffusion of gases ($O_2$ and $CO_2$) across alveolar membrane. 
3. Transport of gases by the blood. 
4. Diffusion of $O_2$ and $CO_2$ between blood and tissues.
5. Utilization of $O_2$ by the cells for catabolic reactions. 

## Mechanism of Breathing 

- Stages: 
    - Inspiration 
    - Expiration 

Exchange of these gases are largely due to the pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. 

- The diaphragm and a specialized set of muscles- **external and internal intercostals** between the ribs 

### Inspiration 

Initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of the thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the sternum causing the increase in volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. This causes the air to move through the nasal passage. 

### Expiration

The relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and the sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic and pulmonary volume. This makes the pressues more than the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of the air from the lungs.

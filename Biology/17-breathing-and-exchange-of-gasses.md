The air we breathe has around $21%$ oxygen and $0.03%$ Carbon dioxide. 

Carbon dioxide is released by the lungs after getting it from the blood. 

Glucose + Oxygen $\rightarrow$ Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy 

Carbohydrate is obtained from food and is transformed to glucose during digestion. 

- Diaphragm is involved in the sucking and releasing of air in and out of the lungs. 
    - By creating areas of low and high air pressure. 

> **Rhinovirus** infects either nasal or neck passage. 

## Epiglotis function

Unwanted particles may go to the wind pipe and it causes the lungs to release the residue air to prevent damage. 

- Sugar syrup causes the epiglotis to swell and it may temporarly stop functioning. 

> Lime + Nicotin $\rightarrow$ volatile complex of $CaCO_3$ 
> 
> This causes the nerve ending to not work and it causes relaxation sensation.

- Cartilate in trachea precents it from collapsing under pressure. 

> **Pleura**: it is a serous membrane that folds back on itself to form a two-layered membranous pleural sac in the lungs.

## Steps involved in Respiration 

1. Breathing or pulmonary ventilation by which atmospheric air is drawn in and $CO_2$ rich alveolar air is released out. 
2. Diffusion of gases ($O_2$ and $CO_2$) across alveolar membrane. 
3. Transport of gases by the blood. 
4. Diffusion of $O_2$ and $CO_2$ between blood and tissues.
5. Utilization of $O_2$ by the cells for catabolic reactions. 

## Mechanism of Breathing 

- Stages: 
    - Inspiration 
    - Expiration 

Exchange of these gases are largely due to the pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. 

- The diaphragm and a specialized set of muscles- **external and internal intercostals** between the ribs 

### Inspiration 

Initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of the thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the sternum causing the increase in volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis. This causes the air to move through the nasal passage. 

### Expiration

The relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and the sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic and pulmonary volume. This makes the pressues more than the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of the air from the lungs.

## Respiratory Volumes and Capacities 

1. **Tidal Volume (TV)**: It is the air inspired or expired during a normal respiration. It's approximately 500 ml and its 6000 to 8000 mL in a healthy man.

2. **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)**: It's the additional volume of air forcefully inspired. **Averages from 2500 to 3000 mL**.

3. **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)**: It's the additional volume a person can forcefully expire. **Averages from 1000 to 1100 mL**.

4. **Residual Volume (RV)**: It's the volume of air in the lungs even afetr a forceful expire. **Averages around 1100 to 1200 mL** 

5. **Inspiratory Capacity (IC)**: Total volume of air a person can inspire after a normal expiration. **This includes tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume (TV+IRV)** 

6. **Expiratory Capacity (EC)**: Total volume of air a person can expire after a normal expiration. **This includes tidal volume and expiratory reserve volume (TV+ERV)** 

7. **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)**: Volume of air that will remain in the lungs after a normal expiration. **This includes ERV+RV** 

8. **Vital Capacity**: It's the maximum volume of air a person can breathe in after a forced expiration. **This includes ERV, TV and IRV** 

9. **Total Lung Capacity**: Total volume of air accomodation in the lungs at the end of a forced inspiration. This includes **RV, ERV, TV and IRV or vital capacity + residual volume** 

> Shallow breathes result in restlessness.  
> Oxygen is toxic for cancer cells.  
> There are 15 to 18 strokes of breathes in a minute.

> The brain only needs oxygen and glucose.

## Exchange of Gases 

<img align=right src=./diagrams/ch17/blood-transport.png width=400> 

- The exchange of gases between lunag alveoli and pulmonary capillaries is called external respiration. 

$O_2$ and $CO_2$ are exchanged in the alveoli by simple diffusion mainly based on pressure/concentration gradient. The **thickness of membrane and the solubility of gases** are also the factor for the rate of diffusion. 

### Partial Pressure 

It is the pressure contributed by an individual gas in the mixture of gases. They are represented by $pO_2$ and $pCO_2$ for oxygen and carbon dioxide respectively. 

#### Partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in different parts (in mmHg)

<div align=center> 

| <center> Respiratory gas    | <center> Atmospheric air | <center> Alveoli  | <center> Blood (deoxygenated) | <center> Blood (oxygenated) | <center> Tissues | 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| $O_2$  | 159 | 104  | 40 | 95 | 40 |
| $CO_2$ | 0.3 | 40 | 45 | 40 | 45 | 

</div> 

----------

- The solubility of $CO_2$ is 20-25 times higher than $O_2$. Therefore it can diffuse through diffusion membrane per unit difference in partial pressure much higher than $O_2$. 

### The Alveoli 

<img align=right src=./diagrams/ch17/alveolus-diagram.png width=400>

- The alveoli are composed of 
    - **Thin squamous epithelium**: composed of **collagen and elastic fibres** which **facilitate flexibility and the capillaries exchange the gases**. 
    - **Basement substance**: **provides support** and helps with the **exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the bloodstream**. It is primarily **composed of extracellular matrix proteins**. It consists of a combination of **collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and various glycoproteins and proteoglycans**.
    - **Basement membrane**: it is a **thin, essential structure made up of collagen, laminin, and other extracellular matrix proteins**. It serves as a **structural support layer separating the alveolar epithelium from blood vessels and connective tissue**, playing a critical role in **gas exchange and maintaining the alveoli's structural integrity**.

Even if these are very packed, the **total thickness is much less than a millimeter**. 

## Transport of Gases 

- Blood is the primary medium of the transport of $O_2$ and $CO_2$. 

97% of $O_2$ is transported by blood and 3% via plasma.  
20-25% of $CO_2$ is transported by RBC and 70% in the form of bicarbonate. Rest about 7% is carried in a dissolved stated through plasma. 

## Transport of Oxygen 

Haemoglobin is a **red colored iron containing pigment** present in the RBCs.

- Each haemoglobin can carry a maximum of 4 molecules of $O_2$. 

Binding of $O_2$ depends on the partial pressure of $O_2$, partial pressure of $CO_2$, $pH$ level and temperature. 

The $O_2$ that is binded with haemoglobin gets transported to the cell via arteries and is dissociated at the tissues. 

> Every 100 ml of oxygenated blood transports 5 ml of $O_2$ to the tissues under normal physiological conditions. 

## Transport of Carbon Dioxide 

$CO_2$ is transported by both haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin and via blood plasma.

When $pCO_2$ is higher, more binding of $CO_2$ occurs and when there's low $pCO_2$ in the alveoli, dissociation of $CO_2$ from carbamino-haemoglobin takes place. 

RBC contains a large amount of carbonic anhydrase and low quantity is present in the plasma. 

Carbonic anhydrase facilitates the following reation in both direction: 

$$
CO_2 + H_2O \overset{\text{Carbonic anhydrase}}{\leftrightarrows} H_2CO_3 \overset{\text{Carbonic anhydrase}}{\leftrightarrows} HCO_3^- + H^+ 
$$

At the tissue where $pCO_2$ is high due to catabolism, $CO_2$ diffuses with blood and form $HCO_3^-$ and $H^+$. At the alveolar site where $pCO_2$ is low, the process reverses leading to the formation of $CO_2$ and $H_2O$. Therefore $CO_2$ trapped as bicarbonate is transported to the alveoli and released out as $CO_2$. 

> Every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood delvers approximately 4 ml of $CO_2$ to the alveoli. 

## Regulation of Respiration 

The rate of respiration is adjusted according to the demands of the body tissues. This actions is performed by the **neural system**. 

The region in the **medulla region** in the brain called **respiratory rhythm center** is responsible for regulation.  
Pneumotaxic center in the pons region moderates the function of respiratory rhythm center. 

A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm center which is sensitive to $CO_2$ and $H^+$. This center makes adjustments to the rhythm in the respiratory process by which those substances can be eleminated. 

## QnA

### How are gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) transported in human body? 

1. Transport of Oxygen 

Haemoglobin is a red colored iron molecule present in the blood stream. $O_2$ binds with haemoglobin forming oxyhaemoglobin and can carry a maximum of 4 molecules of $O_2$. This binding is directly related to the partial pressure of $O_2$. But this can be inhibited by factors such as partial pressure of $CO_2$, $pH$ level and temperature. When in the bloodstream filled with oxygen-rich blood, it depends on diffusion with the cell via blood capillaries. Under suitable conditions for maixumum diffusion the following conditions are required- low $pO_2$, high $pCO_2$, high $H^+$, concentration and higher temperature; the cell has the maximum capacity to dissociate the oxygen from the haemoglobin. 

2. Transport of Carbon Dioxide 

In case of $CO_2$, it is transported in haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobinand through plasma as bicarbonates. When $pCO_2$ is higher than $pO_2$ more binding of $CO_2$ occurs whereas higher $pCO_2$ than $pCO_2$ facilitates the dissociation of $CO_2$ from carbamino-haemoglobin. Both RBC and plasma contains an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase and this starts a reation:

$$
CO_2 + H_2O \overset{\text{Carbonic anhydrase}}{\leftrightarrows} H_2CO_3 \overset{\text{Carbonic anhydrase}}{\leftrightarrows} HCO_3^- + H^+ 
$$

When it is transported to th alveoli, where $pCO_2$ is low, the reaction reverses and converted to $CO_2$ and $H_2O$. Then the $CO_2$ trapped as bicarbonate is transported tot he alveoli and released out as $CO_2$

## Disorders of Respiratory System 

- **Asthama**: Inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles resulting in difficulty in breathing causing wheezing. 
- **Emphysema**: chronic disorder (majority caused by cigarette smoking) in the alveolar walls being damaged, reducing respiratiory surface. 
- **Occupational Respiratory Disorder**: Jobs that have dusty environment, usually grinding and stone breaking causes our defence mechanism to not fully cope with the situation; long exposure inflammates the fibrous tissues leading to lung damage.

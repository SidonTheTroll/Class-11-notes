- Aristotle was the first to distinguish between **living and non-living things**. That's why he is known as the **father of zoology and biology**.

- **Theophrastus** is known as the father of botanology.

- **_1665_**: the invention of the microscope by **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek**

> Heat is the infrared radiation being released and sunglasses filter the IR radiation and we feel cool

> Similar chemical processes lead to similar ideas and the same thinking in the human brain.

- **Sodium and potassium** are required for the movement in the body.

> Doctors are required to write the composition of the medicine.

Microorganisms were discovered by **Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek** in 1665-83.

- The **electron microscope** was invented in **1931** by **Ernst Ruska** and was able to see the DNA branch.

- **Crop physiology**: Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning, or physiology, of plants. Closely related fields include plant morphology, plant ecology, phytochemistry, cell biology, genetics, biophysics and molecular biology.

- **Fishery science**: Fisheries science is the study of freshwater, marine and/or estuarine aquatic systems that involve humans. A fishery is any body of water with which humans interact, such as in the form of fishing or swimming.

- **Microbiology**: Microbiology is the study of the biology of microscopic organisms - viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds, and protozoa. The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations.

> There are 34 biological hotspots worldwide

- Points to define living:

  1.  Growth is internal in living things that are irreversible and vice versa for non-living ones.
  2.  Living beings reproduce
  3.  Metabolism is the biochemical process that goes on inside the cell
  4.  Cellular organization of the cell.

- **Cells are living** because _metabolism is the most important characteristic of defining living_

> All the lifeforms present are collectively called **biological diversity**.

- **Groups**: classifying organisms
- **Taxonomy**: grouping of organisms based on characteristics
- **Nomenclature**: the naming of things

> Nomenclature classification is standardised by binomial nomenclature.
> Binomial nomenclature is a system of naming species in biology using two Latin words, the genus and species names

- Species have a similar morphological structure and also produce fertile offspring

> The above is called the taxonomic hierarchy

- Genus and species are used to name a creature (binomial nomenclature)

- **Carolus Linnaeus** is called the **Father of Modern Taxonomy**

**Latin is a dead language** so it has a solid foundation (no change) so it's fixed <br>

- **Rules for writing nomenclature**
  1. Generic name starts with an uppercase letter and species name starts with a lowercase letter.
  2. Underline the words when handwritten and italics in printed documents. Underlines should not be continuous.
  3. It should be easy to pronounce
  4. Should be written in Latin

<br>

> **Monera** is known as eubacteria (true bacteria)
<br>

- Archaebacteria are known to be the oldest living organisms on Earth. They belong to the kingdom Monera.
- Acidophilic bacteria are also found in tanks with concentrated H2SO4 tanks
- Thermophilic bacteria are found in hot streams

> Eukaria = having eukaryotic cell.

**Systematics**: Systematics is commonly defined as the study of biological diversity and the relationships among organisms.

Taxonomy: classify name by character.

- Taxonomic aids:
  - Museum
  - Zoological park
  - Key
  - Botanical Garden
  - Herbarium

<br>

- Ways to preserve specimens in herbarium sheets:
  1.  Drying: the specimen is dried and pressed between absorbent sheets to remove moisture.
  2.  Mounting: the dried specimen is arranged on a sheet with different parts appropriately positioned
  3.  Gluing: the specimen is glued with non-color adhesive in order not to damage it
  4.  Labeling: Each specimen is labeled with the scientific name, collection date, location, habitat, collector's name and any other data.
  5.  Protection: they are covered with transparent sheets; this protects them from dust, moisture and improper handling.
  6.  Storage: they are stored in specialized cabinets or herbarium cases with a stable and maintained environment (cool temperature, low humidity and minimized light exposure)
  7.  Maintenance: regular inspections and preventive measures for pests, monitoring humidity levels and addressing any issues that could potentially harm the collection.

> Living trees are also planted in the herbarium.

- Kolkata Botanical Garden is the largest botanical garden in India

- All plants are planted properly and habitat-wise to keep a record of them

<br>

- If a species is not in the records, the discoverer can name it and add a description.
- An **arboretum** is a botanical collection composed exclusively of trees of a variety of species

<br>

- Zoological Parks: A zoological park (zoo) is a place where wild animals are kept in captivity. Wild animals are kept in a protected environment and care is taken to provide conditions similar to their natural habitat.

- **Key**: Specific features and characteristics to identify a species.

**Monograph**: Information of one taxon

**Flora**: flower's information about one region

- **Insects** are collected in insect boxes after **collecting, killing and pinning**.
- Plant and animal specimens are also dried and stored.
- Larger animals like birds and mammals are usually stuffed (with cotton) and preserved.
- Museums also have a collection of animal skeletons.

## 4.5. Zoological Parks

> It's a place where wild animals are kept in protected environments under human care.

- It helps us to learn about their food habits and behavior.

## 4.6. Key

> Also called taxonomic key is a valuable tool for identifying plants and animals based on their similarities and differences.

- It relies on contrasting characteristics typically presented in pairs known as couplets, where a choice is made between two opposite options, resulting in the acceptance of one and the rejection of the other.

<br>

- Each statement in the key is called a lead.
- Keys are generally analytical in nature (structured systematically and analytically)

## 4.7. Other means

- **Flora**: detailed book about the plants of a particular region, period or special environment.
- **Fauna**: detailed book about the animals of a particular region, habitat or geological period.

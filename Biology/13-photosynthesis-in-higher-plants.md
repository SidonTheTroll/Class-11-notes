$$
CO_2 + H_0 \rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + H_2O + O_2 

\text{This takes place in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight}
$$

Steps:  
1. Sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll 
2. Conversion of night energy into chemical energy and oxygen is liberated. 
3. Reduction of carbondioxide into carbohydrate. 

- Without chlorophyll $a$, photosynthesis is not possible. 

- Pigment is found is chloroplast. 
    - Extra pigments (chlorophyll b, carotenoids, xanthophyll, anthocyanin, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin) are also present. 

> Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria are also autotrophs. 

- Bacterio chlorophyll is found in some bacteria. 

Mesophyll cells perform photosynthesis.

## Where does Photosynthesis take place? 

> In broad terms, photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts. 

The mesophyll cells in the leaves are in large number where chloroplasts align along the walls for optimum quantity of light.

<img src="./diagrams/ch13/chloroplast.png" width=400 align=right> 

Within the chloroplast, there is a membranous system consisting of grana, stroma lamellae and the matrix stroma.

- Membrane is for trapping light energy and synthesis of ATP and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen).
- In Stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesize sugar, which forms strach. 

|  | Light Reaction   | Dark Reaction |
|-|-|-| 
| Location | Thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts | Stroma of chloroplasts |
| Energy Source | Require light energy (photons) to drive the process | Utilize the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions | 
| Products | Generate ATP, NADPH, and oxygen as a byproduct | Produce glucose and other organic molecules by fixing carbon dioxide | 
| Purpose | Convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) for the next stage | Fix carbon dioxide and synthesize sugars (glucose) from carbon compounds| 
| Depenent on light | Cannot occur in the absence of light |  Can occur in the absence of light, as they rely on the products of the light-dependent reactions for energy | 

## How many types of pigments are involved in Photosynthesis 

- Generally, 4 pigments are crucial in leaves: 
    - Chlorophyll $a$ (bright or blue green)
    - Chlorophyll $b$ (yellow green)
    - Xanthophylls (yellow)
    - Carotenoids (yellow to yellow orange)

Pigments are the substances that help in the absorption of light, at specific wavelenghts. 

- **Chlorophyll $a$ is the most important pigment in photosynthesis**

The red and blue wavelenghts are captured the most in leaves.  
**Therefore, chlorophyll $a$ is the most significant.** 

- Other thylakoid agents like chlorophyll $b$, xanthophyll and carotenoid are also called accessory pigments.

## What is Light Reaction 

<img src="./diagrams/ch13/LHC.png" align=right>

- Light reaction is the phase that includes the following processes: 
    - Light absorption 
    - Water splitting 
    - Oxygen release
    - Formation of ATP and NADPH 

<br> 

- The pigments are classified into two **Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC)**
    - Photosystem I (PS1)
    - Photosystem II (PS2)

> **NOTE**: These are named in the sequence of the discovery and not during light reaction. 

- These LHCs are made up of hundreds of pigment molecules bound to proteins. 

- Each photosystem has all the pigments forming a Light Harvesting system also called antennae 

The various pigments help the plant to capture a broad spectrum of light to make photosynthesis more efficent. 

- A single chlorophyll $a$ molecule forms the reaction center. 

- The PS1 photosystem chlorophyll $a$ has absorption maxima of 700 nm and is called the P700 
- The PS2 photosystem chlorophyll $a$ has absorption maxima of 680 nm and is called the P680

$$
CO_2 + H_0 \rightarrow C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + H_2O + O_2 

\text{This takes place in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight}
$$

Steps:  
1. Sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll 
2. Conversion of night energy into chemical energy and oxygen is liberated. 
3. Reduction of carbondioxide into carbohydrate. 

- Without chlorophyll $a$, photosynthesis is not possible. 

- Pigment is found is chloroplast. 
    - Extra pigments (chlorophyll b, carotenoids, xanthophyll, anthocyanin, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin) are also present. 

> Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria are also autotrophs. 

- Bacterio chlorophyll is found in some bacteria. 

Mesophyll cells perform photosynthesis.

Vascular bungle is surrounded by bundle sheath cells. 

- Generally leaves perform in photosynthesis

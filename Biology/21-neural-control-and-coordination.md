<h1 align=right>Neural Control and Coordination</h1> 

Brain, nervous system and spinal cord maintains control and coordination in out body. 

- It is through chemical and nervous signals 

Nissil's granules are composed of fat. 

Majority of axon has schwan cell which helps to maintain potential difference. 

Brain's grey matter and white matter are nerve cells. 

Schwann cell present = grey  
Schwann cell absent = white 

Dendrites may not always be present in nerve ending. These are called unipolar nerves. 

- **Bipolar**: one dendrite, cell body and axon.
- **Multipolar**: many dendrite, axon and one cell body.

- **Cerebral cortex**: multipolar 
- **Retina**: bipolar 
- **Embryonic stage**: unipolar 

# Transmission of Impulses 

- **Synapse**: junction between nerve cell and axon ending 

**Chemical synapse**: transfer of signals through neurotransmitters  
**Electric synapse**: transfer of signals through electric signals

Brain has no synapse gap whereas other body parts have a gap for chemical exchange and hence called chemical synapse. 

Eyes, nose, tongue, skin and ear give extra imformation about stimuli. 

When more channels are involved, it leads to more response to the stimulus. 

Brain death = biological death 

In body death, only the nerves stop working. 

When the body has some extensions, it has more nerve ending than other parts. 

$K^+$, $Na^+$, $Cl$-$ play an important role in exchange of ions and this creates a difference and triggers nerve signals. 

If $Na$ and $K$ are deficient, it leadsto less impulses and imbalances the body and leads to abnormalities, eg. coma. Some activites may function and other are ceased. 

Without electrolites, not transfer of charges will occur. 

If more $Na^+$ is in the body, it contracts the blood vessels and leads to hypertension. 

Mimosa plant has acetylcholine similar to humans and it is the reson for the stilumus of falling down of leaves by releasing water, a similar function like the nervous system. 

# Brain 

An active brain has more folds but reduces on inactivity. 

- Forebrain
    - Cerebrum 
    - Thalamus 
    - Hypothalamus 

Deep concentration also comes under meditation. 

Environment can also affect brain's activity. 

Mainly, lobes in forebrain deals has limbic system which deals with senses.

Carl Linnaeus started studying plants based on mode of reproduction by flowers. 

Bentham and Hooker divided Plant Kingdom into two divisions: Cryptogamia (non-flowering plants) and Phanerogamia (flowering plants)

Plants were first classified based on the morphology and anatomy and then later classified based evolutionary relationship called Phylogenetic relationship. 

Chemotaxonomy: clasisfication based on chemicals present.
Cytotaxonomy: classified based on cell features 
Numerical taxonomy: clasisfication with the help of computers

Fungus: chitin, heterotroph
Algae: cellulose, autotroph 

Algae generally requires water to survive

Algae: 
    Green Algae (Chlorophyta)
    Red Algae (Rhodophyta)
    Brown Algae (Phaeophyta)
    Diatoms (Bacillariophyta)
    Dinoflagellates (Dinophyta)
    Euglenophytes (Euglenophyta)
    Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria)

[Volvox](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Mikrofoto.de-volvox-4.jpg)

Colony of Chlamydomonas forms a piliminary organism but its not multicellular because every cell is independent and eventually forms a volvox 

• Volvox is almost multicellular because it has some specialized cells and lives in colonies. 

All chlophyll having algae are green but the form of chlorophyll is different. 


Importance of algae: 
    Food and Nutritional Supplements
    Aquaculture and Animal Feed
    Biofuel Production
    Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology
    Wastewater Treatment
    Cosmetic and Personal Care Products
    Agriculture and Fertilizers
    Bioremediation and Carbon Sequestration
    Algal Biomass and Bioproducts
    Tourism and Aquatic Recreation

Downsides of algae: 
    Algal Blooms
    Toxicity
    Contamination of Water Supplies
    High Cost of Cultivation and Harvesting
    Competition with Native Species
    Variable Growth Rates
    Challenges in Scaling Up
    Processing and Extraction Difficulties
    Limited Public Awareness
    Land and Water Use

Plantae
    Thallophyta (embryo absent)
    
    Embryophyta (embryo present)
        Bryophyta (vascular tissue absent)
       
        Tracheophyta (vascular tissue present)
            Pteridophyta (no flower, no seed)
       
            Spermatophyta (flowering plant with seed)
                Gymnospermae (naked seed, no fruit)
       
                Angiospermae (covered seed)
                    Monocotyledon (one seed leaf)
                    Dicotyledon (two seed leaf)


• Algae belongs to thallophyta 
Thallos in latin means green shoot, young branch, twig

• Study of algae is called phycology 

Father of phycology: F. E. Fritsch
Father of Indian phycology: Mandayam Osuri Parthasarathy Iyengar

Basis of algal classification: 
    1. Pigment composition and body color 
    2. Nature and composition of reserved food materials 
    3. Flagellation 

• Rhodophycae is found in warm regions 
    It can also survive in shallow and deep waters 
    Floridean starch is reserved. 
        Similar to amylopectin and glycogen.
    

>>> Laminaria
    Reserved food is called laminarin reserves

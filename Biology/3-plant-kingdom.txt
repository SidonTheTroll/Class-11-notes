Carl Linnaeus started studying plants based on mode of reproduction by flowers. 

Bentham and Hooker divided Plant Kingdom into two divisions: Cryptogamia (non-flowering plants) and Phanerogamia (flowering plants)

Plants were first classified based on the morphology and anatomy and then later classified based evolutionary relationship called Phylogenetic relationship. 

Chemotaxonomy: clasisfication based on chemicals present.
Cytotaxonomy: classified based on cell features 
Numerical taxonomy: clasisfication with the help of computers

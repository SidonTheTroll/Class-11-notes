Differences between Aerobic and Anaerobic respiration. 

| Aerobic | Anaerobic |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| 1. ATP, $H_2O$ and $CO_2$ are formed. | 1. ATP, $CO_2$ and Ethanol are fomed.|
| 2. Happens in the presence of $O_2$| 2. Doesn't need $O_2$ for energy formation. |
| 3. Happens in cytoplasm and mitochondria| 3. Happens only in the cytoplasm. |
| 4. Prominent in organ system level organisms and a lot of ATP is produced. | 4. Prominent in cellular level organisms and very low amount of ATP is produced. |

## Glycolysis

**Isomer**: same chemical formula but different structure. 

- Enzymes involved in glycolysis: 
    - **Isomerase**: change structure without changing formula. 
    - **Invertase**: break down sucrose into glucose and fructose. 
    - **Hexokinase**: phosphorylate glucose, trapping it within the cell and starting the glycolytic pathway.

$$
\text{Glucose} \overset{\text{In cytoplasm}}{\rightarrow} \text{Pyruvic acid} \overset{\text{In mitochondria}}{\rightarrow} H_2O,\ CO_2,\ 38\ APT

$$

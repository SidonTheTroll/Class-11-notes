**Epithelial tissue**: It is a type of biological tissue that forms the protective covering or lining of organs, surfaces, and cavities throughout the body. It serves functions such as protection, absorption, secretion, and sensory reception.

- **Skin**: type of epithelial tissue. 
    - Stratified squamous epithelium
    - Simple squamous epithelium

> Skin cells have a dense nucleus 

- **Wind Pipe**: Columnar epithelium tissue

- **Alimentary canal**: Simple columnar epithelium

Gastric juices are secreted by glandular epithelium tissue. 

- **Nasal passage**: ciliated epithelium

- Stratified epithelium is found in the upper layer of skin.
    - No blood capillaried are connected to it.

- Dry cells that are found in the scalp are the nutrition for fungus. 
    - If a person has untidy hair, the hyphae eats the living cells and cause dandruff and other symptoms. 

## Types

1. **Simple Squamous Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of flat, thin cells.
   - Functions in diffusion, filtration, and secretion.
   - Found in the lining of blood vessels (endothelium), alveoli of lungs, and serous membranes.

2. **Simple Cuboidal Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of cube-shaped cells.
   - Involved in secretion and absorption.
   - Found in kidney tubules, small glands, and the surface of the ovary.

3. **Simple Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of tall, column-shaped cells.
   - Functions in absorption and secretion.
   - Found in the lining of the digestive tract, uterine tubes, and respiratory bronchioles.

4. **Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Appears stratified but is actually a single layer of cells with varying heights.
   - Often possesses cilia and goblet cells.
   - Lines the respiratory tract and parts of the male reproductive system.

5. **Stratified Squamous Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of flat, scale-like cells.
   - Provides protection against abrasion.
   - Found in the skin (epidermis), mouth, esophagus, and vagina.

6. **Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of cube-shaped cells.
   - Rare in the body and typically found in larger ducts of some glands.

7. **Stratified Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of column-shaped cells.
   - Limited distribution in the body, mainly in the pharynx, male urethra, and glandular ducts.

8. **Transitional Epithelium:**
   - Multilayered, dome-shaped cells that change shape when stretched.
   - Allows for stretching and distension.
   - Found in the urinary bladder, ureters, and parts of the urethra.

9. **Glandular Epithelium:**
   - Specialized for secretion.
   - Comprises glands that release substances into ducts or directly into the bloodstream.
   - Includes exocrine and endocrine glands.

## Muscles

- Types: 
    - Voluntary muscles 
    - Involuntary muscles 
        - Smooth 
        - Cardiac 

> Voluntary muscles are not directly connected with the skin, they are connected by tendons and ligaments. 

> All voluntary muscles are striated.

Areolar Tissue: specialized fibre called collagen and elastin 


> Wrinkles form when areolar tissue becomes less firm on age.  
> Vitamin B complex, E and C help to retain elasticity. 

- Plant supplements and water are important for areolar tissue preservation 

> Nutrition from a region a person a belongs to is the most effective.  
> This also decreases the amount of carbon footprint 

> Carbon Credit: It is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.

**Epithelial tissue**: It is a type of biological tissue that forms the protective covering or lining of organs, surfaces, and cavities throughout the body. It serves functions such as protection, absorption, secretion, and sensory reception.

- **Skin**: type of epithelial tissue. 
    - Stratified squamous epithelium
    - Simple squamous epithelium

> Skin cells have a dense nucleus 

- **Wind Pipe**: Columnar epithelium tissue

- **Alimentary canal**: Simple columnar epithelium

Gastric juices are secreted by glandular epithelium tissue. 

- **Nasal passage**: ciliated epithelium 

- Stratified epithelium is found in the upper layer of skin.
No blood capillaries are connected to it.

- Dry cells that are found in the scalp are the nutrition for fungus. 
    - If a person has untidy hair, the hyphae eat the living cells and cause dandruff and other symptoms. 

## Types

1. **Simple Squamous Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of flat, thin cells.
   - Functions in diffusion, filtration, and secretion.
   - Found in the lining of blood vessels (endothelium), alveoli of lungs, and serous membranes.

2. **Simple Cuboidal Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of cube-shaped cells.
   - Involved in secretion and absorption.
   - Found in kidney tubules, small glands, and the surface of the ovary.

3. **Simple Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Single layer of tall, column-shaped cells.
   - Functions in absorption and secretion.
   - Found in the lining of the digestive tract, uterine tubes, and respiratory bronchioles.

4. **Pseudostratified Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Appears stratified but is a single layer of cells with varying heights.
   - Often possesses cilia and goblet cells.
   - Lines the respiratory tract and parts of the male reproductive system.

5. **Stratified Squamous Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of flat, scale-like cells.
   - Protects against abrasion.
   - Found in the skin (epidermis), mouth, esophagus, and vagina.

6. **Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of cube-shaped cells.
   - Rare in the body and typically found in larger ducts of some glands.

7. **Stratified Columnar Epithelium:**
   - Multiple layers of column-shaped cells.
   - Limited distribution in the body, mainly in the pharynx, male urethra, and glandular ducts.

8. **Transitional Epithelium:**
   - Multilayered, dome-shaped cells that change shape when stretched.
   - Allows for stretching and distension.
   - Found in the urinary bladder, ureters, and parts of the urethra.

9. **Glandular Epithelium:**
   - Specialized for secretion.
   - Comprises glands that release substances into ducts or directly into the bloodstream.
   - Includes exocrine and endocrine glands.

## Muscles

- Types: 
    - Voluntary muscles 
    - Involuntary muscles 
        - Smooth 
        - Cardiac 

> Voluntary muscles are not directly connected with the skin, they are connected by tendons and ligaments. 

> All voluntary muscles are striated.

Areolar Tissue: specialized fiber called collagen and elastin 


> Wrinkles form when areolar tissue becomes less firm with age.  
> Vitamin B complex, E and C help to retain elasticity. 

- Plant supplements and water are important for areolar tissue preservation 

> Nutrition from a region a person belongs to is the most effective.  
> This also decreases the amount of carbon footprint 

> Carbon Credit: It is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.

## Classification of Simple and compound Epithelium Tissue 

- Simple Epithelial Tissue:
    - Composed of a single layer of cells.
- Functions:
    - Absorption: Found in areas where absorption of substances is critical, such as the lining of the small intestine.
    - Secretion: Secretes various substances, including hormones and mucus.
    - Filtration: Allows for the passage of small molecules or ions.
- Types of simple epithelial tissue:
    - Simple Squamous Epithelium: Composed of flat, thin cells. Found in the alveoli of the lungs and the lining of blood vessels.
    - Simple Cuboidal Epithelium: Made up of cube-shaped cells. Found in kidney tubules and in glands.
    - Simple Columnar Epithelium: Composed of tall, rectangular cells. Found in the lining of the digestive tract and the uterus.

<br>

- Compound Epithelial Tissue (Stratified Epithelium):
    - Composed of multiple layers of cells.
- Functions:
    - Protection: Provides protection against mechanical, chemical, and physical stress.
    - Barrier Formation: Forms barriers to prevent substances from passing through.
    - Types of compound epithelial tissue:
    - Stratified Squamous Epithelium: Composed of multiple layers of flat cells. Found in the skin (epidermis) and the lining of the oral cavity, esophagus, and vagina.
    - Stratified Cuboidal Epithelium: Rare in the human body, but found in certain ducts of sweat and mammary glands.
    - Stratified Columnar Epithelium: Also relatively rare, found in parts of the male urethra and some areas of the pharynx.
    - Transitional Epithelium: Specialized for stretching and found in the urinary bladder, ureters, and part of the urethra.


> Maximum capillaries are made of squamous epithelium. 

> The ciliated epithelium in the fallopian tube helps to move the egg (ovum) from the ovaries to the uterus by creating a coordinated, sweeping motion with its cilia. This motion is essential for facilitating fertilization and the journey of the fertilized egg (zygote) toward the uterus for implantation.

> **Sebaceous Glands** are also called oil glands. And if they are blocked, it causes pimples. 
>
> Pimple also form due to hormonic reaction but pinching it may hurt the tissues near it and it may cause infection and deposit melanin. 

> Germs can thrive better in warm and moist climate and that's why the area gets infection but not in winters. 

## Mechanism of Sweating 

Sweating, or perspiration, is regulated by the body's thermoregulatory system. When body temperature rises, sweat glands release sweat onto the skin's surface. As sweat evaporates, it cools the body, helping to maintain a stable temperature. This cooling effect is crucial in preventing overheating during physical exertion or hot conditions.

Sweat is initially salty because it contains electrolytes like sodium and chloride. These electrolytes are present in sweat to help maintain the body's electrolyte balance. However, as you continue to sweat during prolonged physical activity or in hot conditions, your body may start to reabsorb some of these electrolytes, making the sweat less salty over time. This reabsorption helps prevent excessive loss of essential electrolytes, which can be harmful.

## Stratified Epithelium

Stratified Epithelium is fixed with the **Basement epithelium** matrix made of collagen 

## Glandular Epithelium 

- **Unicellular**: Sweat 
- **Multicellular**: Salivary 

## Classification of Junctions 

All epithelial cells are held together by little intercellular material called **junction** which provide both structural and functional links between individual cells. It's types are: 

1. **Tight Junctions**: These stop substances from leaking across a tissue.
2. **Adhering Junction**: These junctions perform cementing to keep neighboring cells together. 
3. **Gap Junction**: These junctions help in the intercommunication of the cells by connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining cells for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and sometimes big particles.

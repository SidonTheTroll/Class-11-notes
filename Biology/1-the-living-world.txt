Aristotle was the first to distinguish between living and non-living things. That's why he is known as the father of zoology and biology. 

Theophrastus is known as the father of botanology. 

1665 - the invention of the microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

Heat is the infrared radiation being released 

Sunglasses filter the IR radiation and we feel cool 

Similar chemical processes lead to similar ideas and the same thinking

Sodium and potassium are required for the movement in the body. 

Doctors are required to write the composition of the medicine. 

Microorganisms were discovered by Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek in 1665-83.  

The electron microscope was invented in 1931 by Ernst Ruska and was able to see the DNA branch.  

Crop physiology: Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning, or physiology, of plants. Closely related fields include plant morphology, plant ecology, phytochemistry, cell biology, genetics, biophysics and molecular biology.

Fishery science: Fisheries science is the study of freshwater, marine and/or estuarine aquatic systems that involve humans. A fishery is any body of water with which humans interact, such as in the form of fishing or swimming.

Microbiology: Microbiology is the study of the biology of microscopic organisms - viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds, and protozoa. The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations. 

There are 34 biology hotspots worldwide 

Coal, petroleum, natural gas and wildlife are present in Tinsukia District

Points to define living 

1. Growth is internal in living things that are irreversible and vice versa for non-living ones. 

2. Living beings reproduce

3. Metabolism is the biochemical process that goes on inside the cell 

4. Cellular organization of the cell. 

â€¢ Cells are living because metabolism is the most important characteristic to define living 

All the lifeforms present are collectively called biological diversity. 

Groups: classifying organisms 
Taxonomy: grouping of organisms based on characteristics

Nomenclature: the naming of things 

Nomenclature classification is standardised by binomial nomenclature 

Species have a similar morphological structure and also produce fertile offspring 

Species -> genus -> family -> order -> class -> division/phylum -> kingdom 

The above is called the taxonomic hierarchy 

Genus and species are used to name a creature (binomial nomenclature) 

Carl Linnaeus is called the father of modern taxonomy 

Latin is a dead language so it has a solid foundation (no change) so it's fixed 

__Rules for writing nomenclature__ 
1. Generic name starts with an uppercase letter and species name starts with a lowercase letter. 
2. Underline the words when handwritten and italics in printed documents. 
3. It should be easy to pronounce 
4. Should be written in Latin

Kingdoms: 
	Monera 
	Protista 
	Plantae 
	Fungi 
	Animalia 

Monera is known as eubacteria (true bacteria)

Archaebacteria are known to be the oldest living organisms on Earth. They belong to the kingdom Monera. 

Acidophilic bacteria are also found in tanks with concentrated H2SO4 tanks

Thermophilic bacteria are found in hot streams 

Eukaria = having eukaryotic cell. 

Systematics: Systematics is commonly defined as the study of biological diversity and the relationships among organisms.

Taxonomy: classify name by character. 

Taxonomic aids: 
	Museum 
	Zoological park
	Key 
	Botanical Garden 
	Herbarium 

Ways to preserve specimens in herbarium sheets:
	Drying: the specimen is dried and pressed between absorbent sheets to remove moisture. 
	Mounting: the dried specimen is arranged on a sheet with different parts appropriately positioned 
	Gluing: the specimen is glued with non-color adhesive in order not to damage it 
	Labeling: Each specimen is labeled with the scientific name, collection date, location, habitat, collector's name and any other data. 
	Protection: they are covered with transparent sheets; this protects them from dust, moisture and improper handling. 
	Storage: they are stored in specialized cabinets or herbarium cases with a stable and maintained environment (cool temperature, low humidity and minimized light exposure) 
	Maintenance: regular inspections and preventive measures for pests, monitoring humidity levels and addressing any issues that could potentially harm the collection. 
	

Living trees are also planted in the herbarium. 

Kolkata botanical garden is the largest botanical garden in India 

All plants are planted properly and habitat-wise to keep a record of them 

If a species is not in the records, the discoverer can name it and add a description. 

An arboretum is a botanical collection composed exclusively of trees of a variety of species

>>> Zoological Parks 
	A zoological park (zoo) is a place where wild animals are kept in captivity.
	Wild animals are kept in a protected environment and care is taken to provide conditions similar to their natural habitat.

- Human being are also animal because:
	- Heterotrophs
	- Locomotion 
	- Cell wall absent
	- Mammalary characteristics 

**Zoology**: study of animals  
**Cytology**: study of cell  
**Biochemistry**: study of chemical processes within living beings.  
**Molecular biology**: study of biological processes at a molecular level.  
**Genetics**: study of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms.

## Basis of classification

Classification is based on the level of organization. 

Cell -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ system 

All higher animals have organ system organization 

**Open circulatory system**: blood is not entirely contained within vessels and comes into direct contact with tissues.  
**Closed circulatory system**: blood is contained within vessels and distinct from the interstitial fluid.

Hypertension causes brain arteries to burse and damages the brain. This causes problems and may result in coma and paralysis. To avoid this, one must consume sufficient water, fruits and minimize soidum and do adequate exercies. 

Pressure and diabetes are major cause of fatality. 

- Vertibrates have closed circulatory system. 

## Symmetry

- Bilateral symmetry: two halves equal 
- Radial symmetry: more symmetrical divisions possible
- Asymmetry: no symmetry present.

## Diploblastic and Triploblastic 

- Diploblastic: Ectoderm, mesoglea, endoderm 
- Triploblastic: Ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm

Mesoglea is a gelatinous, non-living substance found between the layers of tissue in cnidarians, such as jellyfish, providing structural support.

## Coelom

- Coelom is the principal body cavity in most animals, located between the intestinal canal and the body wall.

- Coelomate: Possesing coelom 
- Acoelomate: Coelom absent 

Iris diaphragm: The iris diaphragm in a microscope is an adjustable aperture that controls the amount of light reaching the specimen, enhancing visibility and image clarity.

Psuedocoelomate: having coelom but false (its a cavity) 

**Coelomte**: annelids, molluscs, arthropods, chordates
**Acoelomate**: Platyhelminthes

Platyhelminthes (flatworms, liver fluke, etc) don't have full alimentary canal. 

## Segmentation 

**Internal or external division of body in serial repetition**

Eg: earthworm, leech, tapeworm, arthropoda 

## Notochord 

Cartilaginous skeletal rod supporting the organism developed during embryonic development.

Chordata: having notochord. Eg- amphibia, reptilia, aves, mammalia 
Non-chordata: notochord absent. Eg- arthropoda, annelida, mollusca, hemichordata 


## Phylum - Porifera 

Commonly known as sponges 

- Marine and asymmetrical 
- Cellular level organization 
- Digestion is intracellular 
- Skeleton is made of spicules or spongin fibres
- Hermaphoride (bisexual)
  - Asexual reproduction also present 
- Internal fertilization
- Indirect development 

TODO: describe water transport or canal system.

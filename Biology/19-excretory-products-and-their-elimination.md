> If consumed alcohol, the smell is also released through skin through sweat. 

**Excretion**: the process in which an organism removes unwanted and harmful substances from the body is called excretion.

# Human Excretory System 

It consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. 

<img align=right width=300 src="./diagrams/ch19/kidney-location.jpg">

Kidneys are **reddish brown**, **bean shaped** structure that are located between levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity. 

Each kidney of an adult has a dimension of **length 10-12 cm**, **width 5-7 cm** and **2-3 cm thickness** and the weight is around **120-170 grams**. The outer layer of kidney is called renal capsule and it's a hard. 

**Hilum** is a **notch towards the center of the concave surface** of the kidney through which ureter, blood vessels and nervers enter. Inner to the hilum is a **broad funnel shape called renal pelves** with **projections called calyces**. 

The outer layer is a **tough capsule** called ***renal capsule***. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an **outer cortex** and an **inner medulla**. The medulla is further divided into few conical masses called **medullary pyramids** projecting into the calyces. The cortex extends in between medullary pyramids as renal columns called **Columns of Bertini**. 

Each kidney has nearly a million complex tubular structures called **nephrons** which are the funcional units. Each nephron is made of two parts- **Glomerulus and renal tubule**. **Glomerulus** is a collection of capillaries **formed by the afferent arteriole**. Blood from glomerulus is drawn away by efferent arteriole. 

The renal tubule begins with a double walled cup-like structure called **Bowman's capsule** which encloses the glomerulus. The glomerulus combined with Bowman's capsule iscalled **malpighian body or renal corpuscle**. The tubule continues to form a highly coiled structure called **proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)**. A hairpin shaped **Henle's loop** is the next part of the tubule which has an ascending and a descending limb which continues as another highly coiled tubular region called **distral convoluted tubule (DCT)**. The DCT of many nephrons open into a straight tube called **collecting duct** which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids into the calyces. 

The **Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT** of the nephron are situated in the **cortical region** of the kidney whereas the **loop of Henle dips into the medulla**. In **majority of the nephrons**, Henle's loop is **too short and exdends onto very little into the medulla**; such nephrons are called **cortical nephrons**. In a few nephrons, **Henle's loop is very long and runs deep into the medulla** and these are called **juxta medullary nephrons**.

The efferent arteriole eemrging from the glomerulus froms a fine capillar network around the renal tubule called **peritubular capillaries**. A minute vessel runs into the network parallel to Henle's lood forming a 'U' shape called the **vasa rects** and it is present or highly reduced in **cortical nephrons**.

Afferent arteriole is large and efferent arteriole is smaller and this creates a pressure along with coiling which helps to filter the nitrogenous waste. 

While passing through the tube, water, nutrients, etc. are reabsorbed into the blood. 

The blood capillary reabsorbs the nutrients and sent through renal vein. 

## Urine Formation 

Ureter deposits the urine to the urinary bladder. Urine is the totally unwanted product released after filteration. 

Urination is also known as micturition 

Environmental factors also affect the rate of micturition. 

When a body is lacking water, urine is concentrated. After some time, it becomes acidic and it burns the urethra.  
Espesially in hot summer days, this phenomena is seen.

In winters, concentration of urine may cause burning because due to decrease in pH level. 

In one minute, 1/5 of total blood that is released by ventricles is filtered by the kidneys, i.e., 1.1 L to 1.2 L 

In **Ultrafilteration**, 3 layers namely, endothelium, basement membrane and podocyte work together to filter the blood that is supplieid by the afferent arteriole. 

### Podocytes 

<img width=400 src=./diagrams/ch19/renal-corpuscle.svg> 

These are present in the inner lining of glomerulus. 

In the minute gaps of podocytes, the spaces are called filteration slits or slit pores. 

### GFR 

**This is the Glomerular Filteration Rate** 

This is the filteration rate per minute by the glomerulus. 

It is around 125 ml/minute 

### JGA 

**Juxta Glomerular Apparatus** 

It is a special sensitive region in the cortex region formed by cellular modification in distal convoluted tubule and afferent arteriole. 

This stimulates glomerular blood flow by releasing ***Renin hormone***   

Sometimes after functioning, this apparatus becomes dialated in the capillaries, reducing blood flow and pressure; this reduces the filteration rate.  
When **Renin** hormone reaches the region, it contracts the capillaries and makes them continue normal function. Sodium and potassium play an important role in this process. This works like a feedback mechanism. 

180 L filterate is produced in a day.  
But 1.5 L is released. And the rest is reabsorbed.  
Therefore, 178.6 L of filterate is reabsorbed.

All waste gets into the glomerulus.  
Along with the waste, some required materials enters the glomerulus which is reabsorbed.

# Function of the Tubules 

## Proximal Convoluted Tubule 

- Present near the glomerulus. 
- Lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium. 
- Nearly 70-80% of electrolites and water are reabsorbed here. 

This section helps to maintain $pH$ and ionic levels by selective secretion of $H^+$, ammonia and $K^+$. 

## Henle's Loop 

- Descending limb 
    - Permeable to water 
    - Impermeable to electrolites
    - Upper two factors make the solution concentrated. 
    - As the limb gets narrower, pressure is increased to release water into surrounding.
- Ascending limb 
    - Reabsorption is minimal in this part 
    - This region maintains high osmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. 
    - Impermeable to water 
    - Permeable to electrolites and transports them actively and passively.

Note that the last two factors are the reason why the solution gets diluted when transported to collecting duct. 

The electrolites that are released by the ascending limb are released to the medullary fluid. 

## Distal Convoluted Tubule 


# Regulation of Kidney Function 

Kidney finction is monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanism involving **hypothalamus, JGA and Heart** 

- Osmoreceptors are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. 
- Excessive fluid loss activates hypothalamus to release **antidiuteric hormone (ADH)** or vesopressin from neurohypophysis. 

### Antidiuteric Hormone (ADH)

Regulates water absorption from latter parts of tubule, preventing **diuresis**. 

> **Diuresis is the excessive production of urine.**

Then increase in body fluid switches off Osmoreceptors and suppresses ADH release to complete the feedback. 

- ADH affects kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. Causin increase in blood pressure reading to increase Glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR 

# Disorders of the Excretory System 

### Nephritis

Nephrons swell up and malfunctions 

Excess $CA$ creates kidney stones.

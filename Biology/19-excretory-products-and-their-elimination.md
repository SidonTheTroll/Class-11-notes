# Human Excretory System 

It consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. 

<img align=right width=300 src="./diagrams/ch19/kidney-location.jpg">

Kidneys are **reddish brown**, **bean shaped** structure that are located between levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity. 

Each kidney of an adult has a dimension of **length 10-12 cm**, **width 5-7 cm** and **2-3 cm thickness** and the weight is around **120-170 grams**. The outer layer of kidney is called renal capsule and it's a hard. 

**Hilum** is a **notch towards the center of the concave surface** of the kidney through which ureter, blood vessels and nervers enter. Inner to the hilum is a **broad funnel shape called renal pelves** with **projections called calyces**. 

The outer layer is a **tough capsule** called ***renal capsule***. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an **outer cortex** and an **inner medulla**. The medulla is further divided into few conical masses called **medullary pyramids** projecting into the calyces. The cortex extends in between medullary pyramids as renal columns called **Columns of Bertini**. 

Each kidney has nearly a million complex tubular structures called **nephrons** which are the funcional units. Each nephron is made of two parts- **Glomerulus and renal tubule**. **Glomerulus** is a collection of capillaries **formed by the afferent arteriole**. Blood from glomerulus is drawn away by efferent arteriole. 

The renal tubule begins with a double walled cup-like structure called **Bowman's capsule** which encloses the glomerulus. The glomerulus combined with Bowman's capsule iscalled **malpighian body or renal corpuscle**. The tubule continues to form a highly coiled structure called **proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)**. A hairpin shaped **Henle's loop** is the next part of the tubule which has an ascending and a descending limb which continues as another highly coiled tubular region called **distral convoluted tubule (DCT)**. The DCT of many nephrons open into a straight tube called **collecting duct** which converge and open into the renal pelvis through medullary pyramids into the calyces. 

The **Malpighian corpuscle, PCT and DCT** of the nephron are situated in the **cortical region** of the kidney whereas the **loop of Henle dips into the medulla**. In **majority of the nephrons**, Henle's loop is **too short and exdends onto very little into the medulla**; such nephrons are called **cortical nephrons**. In a few nephrons, **Henle's loop is very long and runs deep into the medulla** and these are called **juxta medullary nephrons**.

The efferent arteriole eemrging from the glomerulus froms a fine capillar network around the renal tubule called **peritubular capillaries**. A minute vessel runs into the network parallel to Henle's lood forming a 'U' shape called the **vasa rects** and it is present or highly reduced in **cortical nephrons**.

Afferent arteriole is large and efferent arteriole is smaller and this creates a pressure along with coiling which helps to filter the nitrogenous waste. 

While passing through the tube, water, nutrients, etc. are reabsorbed into the blood. 

The blood capillary reabsorbs the nutrients and sent through renal vein. 

## Urine Formation 

Ureter deposits the urine to the urinary bladder. Urine is the totally unwanted product released after filteration. 

Urination is also known as micturition 

Environmental factors also affect the rate of micturition. 

When a body is lacking water, urine is concentrated. After some time, it becomes acidic and it burns the urethra.  
Espesially in hot summer days, this phenomena is seen.

In winters, concentration of urine may cause burning because due to decrease in pH level. 

In one minute, 1/5 of total blood that is released by ventricles is filtered by the kidneys, i.e., 1.1 L to 1.2 L 

In **Ultrafilteration**, 3 layers namely, endothelium, basement membrane and podocyte work together to filter the blood that is supplieid by the afferent arteriole. 

### Podocytes 

<img width=400 src=./diagrams/ch19/renal-corpuscle.svg> 

These are present in the inner lining of glomerulus. 

In the minute gaps of podocytes, the spaces are called filteration slits or slit pores. 

### GFR 

**This is the Glomerular Filteration Rate** 

This is the filteration rate per minute by the glomerulus. 

It is around 125 ml/minute 

### JGA 

**Juxta Glomerular Apparatus** 

It is a special sensitive region in the cortex region formed by cellular modification in distal convoluted tubule and afferent arteriole. 

This stimulates glomerular blood flow by releasing ***Renin hormone***   

Sometimes after functioning, this apparatus becomes dialated in the capillaries, reducing blood flow and pressure; this reduces the filteration rate.  
When **Renin** hormone reaches the region, it contracts the capillaries and makes them continue normal function. Sodium and potassium play an important role in this process. This works like a feedback mechanism. 

180 L filtrate is produced in a day.  
But 1.5 L is released. And the rest is reabsorbed.  
Therefore, 178.6 L of filtrate is reabsorbed.

---

All waste gets into the glomerulus.  
Along with the waste, some required materials enters the glomerulus which is reabsorbed.

# Function of the Tubules 

## Proximal Convoluted Tubule 

- Present near the glomerulus. 
- Lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium. 
- Nearly 70-80% of electrolites and water are reabsorbed here. 

This section helps to maintain $pH$ and ionic levels by selective secretion of $H^+$, ammonia and $K^+$. 

## Henle's Loop 

- Descending limb 
    - Permeable to water 
    - Impermeable to electrolites
    - Upper two factors make the solution concentrated. 
    - As the limb gets narrower, pressure is increased to release water into surrounding.
- Ascending limb 
    - Reabsorption is minimal in this part 
    - This region maintains high osmolarity of medullary interstitial fluid. 
    - Impermeable to water 
    - Permeable to electrolites and transports them actively and passively.

Note that the last two factors are the reason why the solution gets diluted when transported to collecting duct. 

The electrolites that are released by the ascending limb are released to the medullary fluid. 

## Distal Convoluted Tubule 

- Conditional reabsorption of $Na^+$ and $H_2O$ takes place here. 
- Also capable of absorpion of $HCO_3^-$ and selective secretion of $H^+$, $K^+$ and $NH^3$ to maintain $pH$ and $Na$-$K$ balance in blood. 

## Collecting Duct 

- Extends from the cortex to the inner part of medulla.
- Large amount of water could be reabsorbed here to produce concentrated urine. 
- Also releases urea to later part of Henle's loop to maintain osmolarity. 
- Maintains $pH$ and ionic balance by selective secretion of $H^+$ and $K^+$

# Mechanism of Concentration of Filtrate 

- Mammals have the ability to produce concentrated filtrate. 
- The **Henle's loop and Vasa Recta (vein that is near Henle's loop)** plays a significant role in concentration. 

**The flow of filtrate in the Henle's loop is in opposite directions in the limbs. Therefore it forms a counter current.** 

Proximity between Henle's loop and vasa recta and counter current helps maintaining increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary intersitium of 300 mOsmol/L in the cortex to around 1200 mOsmol/L in inner medulla. This gradient is caused by $NaCl$ and urea. 

- $NaCl$ is transported by ascending limb of **Henle's loop** and exchanged with the descending limb of **vasa recta**.
- Similarly, small amounts of urea enters the thin segment of ascending limb of Henle's loop which is transported back to the intersitiuym by the collecting tubule. 

> The above two points describes the special arrangement of Henle's loop and vasa recta called **Counter Current Mechanism**. Which helps to maintain concentration gradient in the medullary intersitium.  
> Presence of such gradient helps an easy passage of water from collecting tubule thereby concentrating the filtrate. 

- Human urine is 4 times concentrated than the initial filtrate.

# Regulation of Kidney Function 

Kidney finction is monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanism involving **hypothalamus, JGA and Heart** 

- Osmoreceptors are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. 
- Excessive fluid loss activates hypothalamus to release **antidiuteric hormone (ADH) or vesopressin** from neurohypophysis. 

### Antidiuteric Hormone (ADH)

Regulates water absorption from latter parts of tubule, preventing **diuresis**. 

> **Diuresis is the excessive production of urine.**

Then increase in body fluid switches off Osmoreceptors and suppresses ADH release to complete the feedback. 

- ADH affects kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. Causin increase in blood pressure reading to increase Glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR 

<br> 

- GFR can activate JG cells to release **Renin** under the following conditions
    - Decrease in glomerular blood flow 
    - Decrease in glomerular blood pressure 

<br> 

- **Renin function**: Converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II

Angiotensin II activates adrenal cortex to release **Aldosterone**.

- **Aldosterone**
    - Causes reabsorption of $Na^+$ and $H_2O$ from Distal Convoluted Tubule 
    - Also leads to higher blood pressure and GFR. 
    - Mechanism is known as **Renin-Angitensin Mechanism**.

Increased blood pressure from atria causes heart to release **Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF)**  
ANS causes vasodilation, i.e., dilation of blood vessels and decreases blood pressure.  
This acts as a feedback/check for **Renin-Angitensin Mechanism**.

# Micturition 

Urine that is formed by the nephrons are carried to urinary bladder via collecting duct and stored until a **voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)**  
Signal is initiated by stretching of urinary bladder which gets filled by urine, then stretch receptors of the walls of bladder give signal to CNS.  
CNS passes this signal to initiate contraction of smooth muscles of bladder and simultaneous relaxation of **urethral sphincter** 

The process of release of urine is called micturition and the neural mecahnisms involved is called micturition reflex. 

- Adult human excretes 1 to 1.5 liters of urine per day. 
- That urine contains avarage of 25-30 grams of urea. 
- The pigment that is found is called **urochrome**. 

# Role of other Organs in Excretion 

- Lungs, liver and skin are also involved. 

Lungs, apart from $CO_2$, relase lot of $H_2$ in the form of vapor.  
Liver secretes bile containing substances like **bilirubin, biliverdin, cholestrol, degraded steroid hormones, vitamins annd drugs**. 
**Sweat and sebaceous glands in skin** eliminate certain substance through secretion. Sweat that is produced contains $NaCl$, little urea, lactic acid, etc.

Sebaceous glands eliminate certain substances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum.

# Disorders of the Excretory System 

### Uremia 

Malfunctioning causes accumulation of urea in blood.

The urea in patients suffering from uremia should be removed through hemodialysis. 

### Nephritis

Nephrons swell up and malfunctions 

Excess $Ca$ creates kidney stones.

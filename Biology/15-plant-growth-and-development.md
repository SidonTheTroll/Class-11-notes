# Plant Growth and Development 

# 10/11/2023

Growth not only increase the number of cells increase but also change in shape, size and differentiation. 

All cell are alike in the zygote and by cell division, many cells are developed and take new shape, size, etc. 

Initially, when the cells divide, it **looks the same but then it acquires its shape and structure according to the location**. This is known as differentiation.

Dedifferentiation is the process in which the developed cells lose their ability to divide. 

Redifferentiation is when the plant, under certain conditions, regain the ability to divide. This is called redifferentiation. 

Meristematic tissue have the power of division.  
It is present in apical mesistem (height), node (increase node size) and lateral meristem (increase circumference). 

## Totipotent 

Every plant cells has the capacity to convert into new plant.  
By tissue culture, a new plant can be developed. This is called **totipotency**.

Eg: take bud, tip, root, etc. Extract 100 cells and culture them to produce 100 plants. 

## Growth Rate 

**Arithmetic difference**: grows by a fixed amount, i.e., divides the cell into two parts. 

> Plant takes time for adjustment and then grows rapidly.  
> Take marigold, first takes 2-3 days to adjust/adapt, it grows rapidly and then grows steadily. 

With respect to time, the growth becomes steady, then grows rapidly then becomes steady again. 

Height increases in plant but it becomes slow. This is not present in human beings. 

- **Growth**: 
    - **Absolute**: measurement of growth per unit time (actual growth)
    - **Relative**: measurement of growth by comparison to another. 

For relative growth, take the example for two leaves, one is 5 $cm^2$ and another is 50 $cm^2$. Each grows by 5 $cm^2$ and one will grow 50% of its size and the other will grow by 5.5%. Therefore, the smaller leaf will grow much more. 

Note that plants never grow exponentially.

## Plant Growth Regulators 

These are also called phytohormones and these are non-nutritive chemicals produced by the organism. 

## Plant Hormones 

These are **chemical messengers** that carry instructions for the body parts. Generally secreted by endocrine gland (ductless and present in animals) 

> Whereas exocrine glands have ducts 

Hormones are made up of protein and/or steroids.  
They are produced in minute quantities to avoid bodily disruptions.   
These are also target specific. 

- Plants don't have nervous system and everything is controlled by hormones. 

Out of 5 phytohormones, 3 are growth-promoting and 2 are growth-retarding. 

### Auxin 

This is derived from Greek word 'auxein' which means to grow. And it was first isolated from human urine. 

This word is associted with chemicals like indole-3-acetic acid and other natural and synthetic compounds having growth stimulating and regulating properties. 

Theses are synthesized in growing apices and roots from which they migrate to the regions of their actions. 

Synthetic Auzins include NAA (napthlalene acetic acid) and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) which are used in agriculture and horticulture practices. 



Apical Dominance: central stem of the plant is dominant over other side stems/branches. 

2, 4-D hormone is used as weedicide. 

Weed is a plant that is agriculturally unwanted and competes for space, nutrients and sunlight. 

**Induced parthenocarpic fruit**: fruit developed without fertilization. Eg: banana 

### Gibbrellins 

These are also growth promoting hormones 

More than 100 are known and reported from fungi and higher plants. 

These are denoted as $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, etc. 

$G_3$ is known as gibberellic acid and was the first to be intensively studied. 

These are acidic. 

- Functions: 
    - These are responsible for physiological responses. 
    - Increases internodal length.
    - Inhibits senescence before maturity in leaves, fruits, etc.
    - Improves shape of fruits.
    - Helps to induce flowering. 

- For its properties, its also used in horticulture proceses.

### Cytokinin 

Mainly works wish auxin. 

Since the discovery of zeatin, several maturally occuring cytokinin have been identified and some synthesized which promote cell division. 

Natural cytokinin are synthesized in regions with rapid cell division. Eg.- root apices, developing shoot buds, young fruits, etc. 

Cytokinin help to produce leaves, chloroplasts in leaves, lateral shoot growth and adventitious shoot formation. It also helps to overcome apical dominance.  
This also promotes nutrient mobilization which delays leaf senescence. 

### Abscisic Acid 

> Also known as Stress hormone 

- Functions
    - Regulates abscission and dormance. 
    - Acts as growth and metabolism inhibitor.
    - Stimulates the closure of stomata and increases tolerance to various stresses. 
    - Playes improtant role in seed development, maturation and dormancy.

In most of the cases, it acts as antagonist hormone because it opposes growth. 

This also helps the seed to not germinate under unfavourable conditions. 

Due to abscission in fruit's stem, its weight causes it to fall off. 

The abscission zone in leaf causes the xylem and phloem to cut off and its causes it to dehydrate and fall off. 

Abscisic acid also closes the stomata in hight temperature to prevent water loss. 

This helps seeds to sprout in proper time.

### Ethylene 

- It is a gaseous PGR 
- It is synthesized in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence and ripening fruits. 
- Influences
    - Horizontal growth of seedling 
    - Swelling of axis 
    - Apical hook formation (in dicot seedling)
- Functions 
    - Promotes senescence and abscission of plant organs especially leaves and flowers. 
    - Ripens fruits. 
    - Enhances respiration rate during ripening of fruit. This is called respiratory climactic. 
    - Breaks seed and bud dormancy.
    - Initiates germination (peanut seeds, sprouts potato tubers)
    - Helps leaves/upper parts of shoot remain above water. 
    - Promotes root and root hair formation; increasing absorption surface. 
    - Initiates flowering and synchronizes fruit-set in pineapples. 
    - Induces flowering in mango. 

> **Fruit set**: formation of fruit. 

- Along with root, the root hair are also important for absorption. 

It is one of the most widely used PGR in agriculture. 

One of the most widely used source of ethylene is ethephon.  
It is an aqueous solution and readily absorbed and transported within plant and releases ethylene slowly. 

Ethephon hastens fruit ripening in tomatoes and apples and accelerates abscission in flowers and fruits (thinning of cotton, cherry, walnut)

Ethephon promotes female flowers in cucumbers, thereby increasing the yield. 

# Photoperiodism 

- Types 
    - Long day plant: needs long sunlight exposure to flower 
    - Short day plant: needs low sunlight exposure but doesn't flower when the sunlight is too strong. 
    - Day neutral plant: it doesn't matter if the sunlight is strong or weak. It just needs a bit of light to flower. 

Formation of flower is dependent on sunlight exposure. 

Darkness is important for short day plants. 

# Vernalization

It means to treat plants with low temperature which induces early flowering. 

Note that this is not possible in all plants.

# Extra 
Light and temperature also affect the hormone release and plant growth. 

In winter, sieve tubes get blocked by wax deposition and inhibiting growth.   
In spring, it is melted and transportation is resumed. 

**Lenticular transpiration**: transpiration through lenticle 

- **Bonemeal**: crushed bone powder used to provide nutrients to plants. 

**Pruning**: cutting by the upper part of the plant (generally mid-September to early October) to facilitate the growth of new twigs.

# Plant Growth and Development 

# 10/11/2023

Growth not only increase the number of cells increase but also change in shape, size and differentiation. 

All cell are alike in the zygote and by cell division, many cells are developed and take new shape, size, etc. 

Initially, when the cells divide, it **looks the same but then it acquires its shape and structure according to the location**. This is known as differentiation.

Dedifferentiation is the process in which the developed cells lose their ability to divide. 

Redifferentiation is when the plant, under certain conditions, regain the ability to divide. This is called redifferentiation. 

Meristematic tissue have the power of division.  
It is present in apical mesistem (height), node (increase node size) and lateral meristem (increase circumference). 

## Totipotent 

Every plant cells has the capacity to convert into new plant.  
By tissue culture, a new plant can be developed. This is called **totipotency**.

Eg: take bud, tip, root, etc. Extract 100 cells and culture them to produce 100 plants. 

## Growth Rate 

**Arithmetic difference**: grows by a fixed amount, i.e., divides the cell into two parts. 

> Plant takes time for adjustment and then grows rapidly.  
> Take marigold, first takes 2-3 days to adjust/adapt, it grows rapidly and then grows steadily. 

With respect to time, the growth becomes steady, then grows rapidly then becomes steady again. 

Height increases in plant but it becomes slow. This is not present in human beings. 

- **Growth**: 
    - **Absolute**: measurement of growth per unit time (actual growth)
    - **Relative**: measurement of growth by comparison to another. 

For relative growth, take the example for two leaves, one is 5 $cm^2$ and another is 50 $cm^2$. Each grows by 5 $cm^2$ and one will grow 50% of its size and the other will grow by 5.5%. Therefore, the smaller leaf will grow much more. 

Note that plants never grow exponentially.

## Plant Growth Regulators 

These are also called phytohormones and these are non-nutritive chemicals produced by the organism. 

## Plant Hormones 

These are **chemical messengers** that carry instructions for the body parts. Generally secreted by endocrine gland (ductless and present in animals) 

> Whereas exocrine glands have ducts 

Hormones are made up of protein and/or steroids.  
They are produced in minute quantities to avoid bodily disruptions.   
These are also target specific. 

- Plants don't have nervous system and everything is controlled by hormones. 

Out of 5 phytohormones, 3 are growth-promoting and 2 are growth-retarding. 

### Auxin 

Auxin is very important growth hormone. 

It is the most significant in the apical meristem. 

Apical Dominance: ? 

2-4-D hormone is used as weedicide. 

Weed is a plant that is agriculturally unwanted and competes for space, nutrients and sunlight. 

**Induced parthenocarpic fruit**: fruit developed without fertilization. Eg: banana 

### Gibbrellins 

These are also growth promoting hormones 

More than 100 are known and reported from fungi and higher plants. 

These are denoted as $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, etc. 

$G_3$ is known as gibberellic acid and was the first to be intensively studied. 

These are acidic. 

- Functions: 
    - These are responsible for physiological responses. 
    - Increases internodal length.
    - Inhibits senescense before maturity in leaves, fruits, etc.
    - Improves shape of fruits.
    - Helps to induce flowering.

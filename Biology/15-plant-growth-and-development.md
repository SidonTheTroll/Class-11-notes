Growth not only increase the number of cells increase but also change in shape, size and differentiation. 

All cell are alike in the zygote and by cell division, many cells are developed and take new shape, size, etc. 

Initially, when the cells divide, it **looks the same but then it acquires its shape and structure according to the location**. This is known as differentiation.

Dedifferentiation is the process in which the developed cells lose their ability to divide. 

Redifferentiation is when the plant, under certain conditions, regain the ability to divide. This is called redifferentiation. 

Meristematic tissue have the power of division.  
It is present in apical mesistem (height), node (increase node size) and lateral meristem (increase circumference). 

## Totipotent 

Every plant cells has the capacity to convert into new plant.  
By tissue culture, a new plant can be developed. This is called **totipotency**.

Eg: take bud, tip, root, etc. Extract 100 cells and culture them to produce 100 plants. 

## Growth Rate 

**Arithmetic difference**: grows by a fixed amount, i.e., divides the cell into two parts. 

> Plant takes time for adjustment and then grows rapidly.  
> Take marigold, first takes 2-3 days to adjust/adapt, it grows rapidly and then grows steadily. 

With respect to time, the growth becomes steady, then grows rapidly then becomes steady again. 

Height increases in plant but it becomes slow. This is not present in human beings. 

- **Growth**: 
    - **Absolute**: measurement of growth per unit time (actual growth)
    - **Relative**: measurement of growth by comparison to another. 

For relative growth, take the example for two leaves, one is 5 $cm^2$ and another is 50 $cm^2$. Each grows by 5 $cm^2$ and one will grow 50% of its size and the other will grow by 5.5%. Therefore, the smaller leaf will grow much more. 

Note that plants never grow exponentially.

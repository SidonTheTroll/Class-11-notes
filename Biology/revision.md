Taxon: A taxon is defined as a collection of one or more populations of organisms

Alternation of generation: alternation between haploid and diploid during two different phases in the life cycle. 

Algae reproduce by meiosis to form diploid cells. 

Haplontic lifecycle: haploid phase is significant in organism

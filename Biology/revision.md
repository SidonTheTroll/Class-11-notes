Coenocytic hyphae is found in phycomycetes

Taxon: A taxon is defined as a collection of one or more populations of organisms

Alternation of generation: alternation between haploid and diploid during two different phases in the life cycle. 

Algae reproduce by meiosis to form diploid cells. 

Haplontic lifecycle: haploid phase is significant in organism 

Viroid: infectious RNA carrying molecule 

Prion: oily protein coated molecule 

Bacteriophage: DNA 
TMV: RNA 
HIV: DNA 
SARS Cov-2: RNA 

Antizen: any foreign protein which can provoke or activate our immunity system.

### Directions for Q. No. 8, 9 and 10
In these three questions, the Assertions (A) and Reasons (R) have been put forward. Read both the statements carefully and choose the correct alternative from the following: 

(a) Both the Assertion and the Reason are correct and Reason is the correct explanation for the Assertion.  
(b) The Assertion and the Reason are correct but Reason is not the correct explanation for the Assertion.  
(c) Assertion is true but the Reason is false.  
(d) Assertion is false but the Reason is true. 

## 8.
**Assertion**: Chlorophyceae is green in color.  
**Reason**: They are green due to the presence of chlorophyll $a$ and $b$.

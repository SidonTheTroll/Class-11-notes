# Section D 
## Case-Based Question
31. Stoichiometry is a section of chemistry that involves a calculation based on chemical equations Chemical equations are governed by laws of chemical combination. The mass of reactants is equal to the mass of products. The compound obtained from different methods contains the same elements in the foxed ratio by mass. A mole is a counting unit, equal to $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles. One mole is also equal to molar mass expressed in grams. One mole of every gas at STP has a volume equal to 22.4 L. The reacting species that are consumed in the reaction completely is called limiting reagent which decides the amount of products formed. The concentration of the solution is expressed in terms of molarity, morality, and mole fraction.
    1. Calculate the number of moles of $NH_3$ formed by the reaction of 2 moles of $N_2$ and 2 moles of $H_2$, $N_2 (g) + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3 (g)$.
    2. Calculate number of electrons in 18 g of $H_2O$. [Atomic number of H = 1, O = 8]
32. Read the passage and answer the questions that follow:  
The attractive force which holds the two atoms together is called a chemical bond. A covalent bond is formed by an equal sharing of electrons. A coordinate bond is formed by unequal sharing of electrons. An ionic bond is formed by the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. Octet rule, although very useful but not universally applicable. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond is formed by overlapping of half-filled atomic orbitals resulting in a lowering of energy and more stability. Bond order is the number of bonds between atoms in a molecule. The higher the bond order more stability and bond dissociation enthalpy but the smaller the bond length. The polarity of a covalent bond depends upon the difference in electronegativity. The covalent character of a bond depends upon polarising power, smaller cations and bigger anions have higher polarising power. VSEPR theory helps to predict the shapes of molecules. 
    1. Write the electron dot structure of $N_2O$.
    2. Draw the structure of $XeOF_4$ on the basis of VSEPR theory.

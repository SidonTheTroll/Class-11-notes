1. Read the passage given below: (8)

- Good decoration reflects the personality of the people who live in the home. It should, first of all, be distinctive, just as each person is distinctive. A home should have unity not only within each room but also throughout the house. Rooms should, to some degree, harmonize with each other. The color and styling of each room, particularly, should fit into the color and styling of the rooms which run out of it. 
- Attractive home furnishing set the stage for pleasant living. If they are in expression of yourself, you will have a feeling of satisfaction every time you enter your home, and friends will share your enjoyment. 
- However, furnishing and surroundings expressive of just the right note of restfullness, bright colors, or elegant simplicity are not often assembled by accident. Even enthusiasm alone is not enough. For most home decorators, it takes pouring over plans, trying color schemes, finding ingenious ways to make the best of what you have, and shopping around to search out just the right purchases at prices you can afford to pay. But there is keen pleasure in striving for the perfect result, and great satisfaction in achieving it. 
- A successful house and successful rooms will depend upon the proper relationship of each element in it to the others and to the whole. Therefore, in selecting each piece it is well to consider the background, the usage, the draperies, the floor covering, the upholstering materials, the woods, shapes, color schemes, and the "feeling" you prefer for the room. 
- Work and plan to enjoy your house. Limit the expenditures of time, effort and money to the extent of your abilities, so that just runnign the house doesn't dominate your life. Elegance and delicate things may be a drain you can afford only in a limited way. If you can't afford outside help, select a house and furnishings that require less care. Plan your activities so that tumult and upset are limited to a few rooms - an activity room or a bedroom, or a comer of the dining room. 
- You'll get more pleasure out of a house if you have a hobby connected with it - collecting glass or antiques, gardening or indoor flower growing ceramics, art, cookign, decorating, flower arrangements, etc. And you'll get more satisfam and a great deal of help from studying household activities. 
- You can select a pleasing combintion of colors from a wallpaper, a fabric, an oriental mug, a flower or scene, or even a picture in a magazine.If you don't already have the furniture or mugs, its a good idea to make up a color scheme in this way. Let one color predominate. Limit a color scheme to two or three colors, with white or gray tones.

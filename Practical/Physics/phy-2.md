# Aim of the experiment

To measure internal diameter and depth of a given beaker using Vernier callipers and hence find its volume.

# Apparatus required

Vernier callipers, beaker

# Theory

1. Vernier constant = 1 MSD - 1 VSD
2. Zero error, e $\pm$ no. of vernier division coinciding with some main scale division \* VC
3. Zero correction, $c$ = $-$ zero error = $-e$
4. Observed length = MSR + VSR = $N + (n * VC)$
5. Volume = $\pi (\frac{D}{2})^2 h$

# Observation and Calculation

# Result

The internal volume of the beaker is $\underbar{113.7446}$ $cm^3$.

# Precautions

1. Vernier scale should move smoothly over the main scale.
2. VC and zero error should be carefully determined and recorded.
3. Beaker should be gripped gently between the jaws.
4. Eye should be directly over the Vernier division to avoid parallax.
5. Each observation should be recorded with correct significant figures and units.

# Sources of Error

1. Jaws of VC may not be perpendicular to main scale.
2. The VC may be loose.
3. The scale graduation may not be correct.
4. The scale graduation of the instrument may not have been taken into account.
5. Personal error due to parallax and improper reading.

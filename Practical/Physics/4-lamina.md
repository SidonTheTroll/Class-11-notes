# Aim of the experiment 

To measure the thickness of a given sheet using screw gauge and to find the volume of the sheet using Standard Wire Gauge table. 

# Apparatus Required 

Screw gauge, lamina, graph paper 

# Theory 

1. Pitch = \frac{\text{Distance moved by the screw on linear scale}}{\text{Number of rotation of circular scale}}

2. Least count = \frac{\text{Pitch}}{\text{Total number of divisions on the circular scale}}

3. Total Reading = LSR + CSR * Least count 
\implies

- Make the potato stable by cutting the base flat 
- Make a well like structure in the potato that shouldn't go more than middle of the potato 
- Keep potato in a bowl 
- Fill the bowl with water and keep the potato in it without submerging it. 
- Fill the cutout in the potato with concentrated salt solution. 
- Mark the salt water level with a paper pin. 

After 3 hours or so, it will be observed that the potato has absorbed the water and now more than half of it is filled with water and this shows osmoregulation. 

**Refer to Chapter Osmosis, page 39 of Biology Lab Manual for more info**

# Aim of the Experiment 

To study the process of osmosis by Potato Osmometer. 

# Material Required

Potato, knife, sugar/salt, petridish, alpin, etc. 

# Procedure 

Take a potato and peel off its outer covering from one end of a potato and make it flat with the help of a knife. From the outer side of potato, make a big cavity upto the flat bottom. Put some concentrated salt/sugar solution in this cavity and mark its initial level by injecting alpin in the wall of the cavity. Place the potato in the flat end in the petridish of water but the level of water in the petridish shouldn't be higher than the salt/sugar solution in the potato cavity. Place this potato as such for sometime and then observe. 

# Observation 

A level of sugar/salt solution in the cavity rise up and then mark its final level. 

# Result 

The level of salt/sugar solution in the cavity rise up as a result of endosmosis.

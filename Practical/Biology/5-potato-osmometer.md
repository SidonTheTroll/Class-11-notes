- Make the potato stable by cutting the base flat 
- Make a well like structure in the potato that shouldn't go more than middle of the potato 
- Keep potato in a bowl 
- Fill the bowl with water and keep the potato in it without submerging it. 
- Fill the cutout in the potato with concentrated salt solution. 
- Mark the salt water level with a paper pin. 

After 3 hours or so, it will be observed that the potato has absorbed the water and now more than half of it is filled with water and this shows osmoregulation.

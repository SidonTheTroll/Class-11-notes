  - Simple microscope 
  - Compound microscope

- Adjusting microscope focus:
    1. Place the slide
    2. Use low power objective
    3. Coarse adjustment
    4. Fine adjustment 
    5. Switch to higher magnification 
    6. Refine focus 
    7. Center the specimen
    8. Use proper lighting
    9. Repeat if necessary 

**Conclusion:** In summary, this conclusion will outline fundamental concepts required in maintaining a project notebook. This foundational understanding sets the stage for further in-depth exploration and discovery within the realm of biology. 

- **Precautions:** 
    - On using microscope, don't shake the system 
    - Microscope should only be opened for maintainence.

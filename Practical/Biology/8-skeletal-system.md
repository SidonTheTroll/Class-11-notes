1st vertebra is fused with the skull and forms pivotal joint. 

Cushions are made of cartilage for flexibility and jointing

Scapula is a large, triangle and flat bone. 

Ball and socket joint is also called **spheroid joint** 

- Parts:
    - Humerus 
    - Radius, ulna 
    - Carpal 
    - Metacarpal 
    - Phalanges 

# Leg 

Has longest bone in the body, i.e., femur 

Height increased due to femur length. 

Environmental conditions can change from length. 

Only increase till age 21 but circumference may increase later. 

Also depends on genetics. 

Platella: helps to move joint 

- Fibula: long

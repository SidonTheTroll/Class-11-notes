# Aim of the Experiment 

To check the presence of monosaccharide in a given solution. 

# Material Reuired

| 1 | **Benedict's test**: Take 2 ml of test solution. Add 2-3 drops of Benedict's solution and heat the test tube. | Brick red percipitate of cupric oxide is formed | Monosaccharide is present | 
| 2 | **Fehling's test**: Take 2 ml of test solution. Add 2-3 drops of Fehling's reagent (mix fehling A + Fehling B in equal proportion) and heat the test tube. | Brick red percipitate is formed | Monosaccharide is present | 

# Precautions 

1. Take less amount of solutions to avoid delaying of process. 
2. Heat the solution until it turns brick red.

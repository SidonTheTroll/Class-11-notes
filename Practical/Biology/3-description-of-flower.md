- Experiment no- 3

# Aim of the experiment

To dissect flower and learning floral diagram 

# Materials required

*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*, needle plastic handle, surgical knife


# Observation: 

Ways to dissect flower: 
1. Remove epicalyx 
2. Expose Calyx
3. Cut calyx in transverse axis without cutting other part.
4. Expose and start pulling out corolla. 
5. Use needle to separate stamen from carpel.
6. Pull out stamen or apply precise cut to remove it.
7. Apply adjustment cuts to remove unwanted parts from gynoecium. 

## Drawing floral diagram 

1. Choose a fixed point of reference for the axis. 
2. Determine floral symmetry
3. Draw a circle 
4. Add sepals 
5. Add petals 
6. Add stamens 
7. Add carpels 
8. Indicate ovary position 

> Draw floral diagram yourself. 

# Conclusion 

In brief, the practical involving Hibiscus rosa-sinensis dissection and floral diagram creation deepened our understanding of flower anatomy and reproductive processes. Dissection unveiled key components, from epicalyx to androecium and gynoecium, while diagramming visually reinforced our learning, ultimately enhancing our grasp of plant reproduction.

# Precautions 

- Wear safety gear: gloves and safety goggles.
- Handle sharp tools carefully.
- Gently handle specimens to avoid damaging structures.
- Maintain a clean and organized workspace, clean spills promptly.
- Wash hands after the practical to prevent contamination.
- Use tools for their intended purpose and handle responsibly.

## Conclusion 

In summary, this experiment distinguished with many parasites, fishes, reptiles, bird and animal. By analyzing their distinct traits and behaviors, we successfully identified each organism's phylum and class. This experiment emphasized the significance of taxonomy in comprehending animal diversity and adaptation to different habitats.

## Precautions

1. Do not tilt the container holding the specimen.
2. Handle the specimen with care.
3. If handling alive specimen, use proper specific procedures.

# Aim of the experiment 

To identify animal specimen

# Observation 

## Amoeba 

Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Protozoa  
Class: Rhizopoda  
Genus: *Amoeba*  
Species: *proteus* 

1. It doesn't has a fixed shape. 
2. It is unicellular and found in fresh water bodies.
3. Protoplasm is differentiated into outer ectoplasm and inner endoplasm. 
4. Prominent nucleus is located in the center. 
5. Nutrition is holozoic 

## Hydra 

Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Coelenterata  
Class: Hydrozoa  
Genus: *Hydra*  
Species: oligactis

1. Inhibits in fresh water bodies.  
2. It is cylindrical with radial symmetry.  
3. It is diploblastic.  
4. It is attatched to structure with flat basal disc. 
5. Mature hydra forms buds to reproduce. 

## Liver-fluke 

Kingdom: Animalia  
Phylum: Platyhelminthes  
Class: Trematoda  
Genus: *Fasciola*  
Species: *hepatica* 

1. It is endoparasite in ruminants 
2. Mouth lise at the front end surrounded by oral sucker. 
3. Genital pore lise in between the two suckers. 
4. Excretory pore occurs on the ventral side at the extreme posterior end. 
5. Ventral sucker lies before oral sucker 

## Conclusion 

In summary, this experiment distinguished and classified amoeba, hydra and liver-fluke. By analyzing their distinct traits and behaviors, we successfully identified each organism's phylum and class. This experiment emphasized the significance of taxonomy in comprehending animal diversity and adaptation to different habitats.

## Precautions

1. Do not tilt the container holding the specimen.
2. Handle the specimen with care.
3. If handling alive specimen, use proper specific procedures.

## Aim of the experiment

To study the change in pH by titrating strong acid with a strong base using universal indictor.

## Apparatus Required

10 ml pipette, conical flack, beaker, funnel, dropper.

## Chemical Required

HCl, NaOH and Phenolphthalein indicator.

## Theory

The titration of strong acid with a strong base involves neutralization reaction:

$$
\text{NaOH} + \text{HCl} --> \text{NaCl} + \text{H}\underset{2}{}\text{O}
$$

NaOH is taken in the burette and HCl is taken in the conical flask. During titration (i.e., adding NaOH from the burette into the conical flask containing 10 ml HCl) the pH of the solution in the conical flask will increase.

## Procedure

1. Take a burette and fill it with NaOH solution and note down the initial reading.
2. Take 10 ml pipette and add 0.1 M of HCl into the conical flask.
3. Add few drops of Phenolphthalein into the conical flask.
4. Now slowly add drops of NaOH from the burette until the solution turns purple.
5. Note the observations on the burette and repeat the procedure more times for accuracy.

## Observation

| S.No | Initial reading | Final reading | Difference |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| 1.   | 0               | 8.2           | 8.2        |
| 2.   | 8.2             | 16.4          | 8.2        |
| 3.   | 16.4            | 24.6          | 8.2        |
| 4.   | 24.6            | 32.8          | 8.2        |

## Conclusion 

The pH of the solution gradually changes with the addition of NaOH solution drop-wise into 10 ml HCl. At the end point there is a sudden change in colour purple.

## Precautions

- Wear safety gear.
- Handle chemicals carefully.
- Ensure good lab ventilation.
- Use calibrated pipettes and burettes.
- Keep accurate records.

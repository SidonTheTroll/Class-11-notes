# Aim of the Experiment 

To study the effect of tensile strength of fiber for an acid and base. 

# Apparatus Required 

Hook, acid, base, different types of fibers, clamp, weight hanger, tweezer, slotted weight and clamp stand. 

# Theory 

Fibers which we see around us are of different kind like thin, long, thread, etc., polymers which and be woven into fabrics. The strong fibers possess strong intermolecular force of attraction which formed between chains: 

The fibers are of two types: 

1. **Natural fibers**: These fibers are originated in plants and animals. Animal fibers are mainly made up of proteins, while fibers of plants are usually made up of cellulose. 

2. **Synthetic fibers**: These are the fibers which are made by humans such as terylene, nylon, rayon, etc. The use of these fibers are continiously increasing because of economic factor and availability. 

On the basis of origination of fibers they are generated. Fibers are differentiated on the basis of their strength, properties and many more. The fibers should not lose its property that is it should not break the bond easily by the affect of air, water, base and acids this factor is called the tensile strength of fibers. 

The strength of the fibers is called as tensile strength. It can be say that tensile strength. It can be say that tensile strength is defined as the extent to which a fibers can be stretched without breaking. 

# Procedures 

1. Take four differnt samples of fibers in equal length. 
2. Take a ring fixer and tie one end of the fibers on an iron stand and the other end with a hanger which carries the weights to keep the fibers gets straighten. 
3. Now, start adding weight onto the weight hanger and observe the stretching of the thread. Increase the weight gradually on the weight hanger till the breaking point is reached. Note minimum weight required to break the cotton thread. 
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for other threads made up of different material and compare their tensile strength. 
5. To study the effect of acid and base on the tensile strength of fibers, dip each type of fabric in dilute $HCl$ or dilute $NaOH$ solution of equal quantity for equal interval time. 
6. After a fixed time interval of time, the fibers are removed from the solution, washed with water and dried in the sun.
7. Determine again the tensile strength of the dried fibers of repeating steps 2, 3 and 4. 

# Observation 

**Length of Fiber**: 20 cm  
**Strength of acid**: 1 $M$ $HCl$ and 5 $M$ $HCl$  
**Strength of base**: 1 $M$ $NaOH$ and 5 $M$ $NaOH$

# Conclusion 

The order of incerasing weight required at the breaking points of threads will be the order of increasing tensile strength.

# Result 

1. The tensile strength of the given fibers in the order _____. 
2. The tensile strength of a fiber is affected by the acid and base effect. The order of the tensile strength of soak fiber is _____.

# Precautions 

1. All the fibers should be taken in same length. 
2. Take same set of weights in every experiment. 
3. Take the reading carefully.

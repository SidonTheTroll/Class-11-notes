# Objective 

This project's core objective is to evaluate the tensile strength of diverse fibers and scrutinize how alkali and acid impact this crucial parameter. Through systematic experiments, we aim to gain insights into the nuanced behavior of different fibers, facilitating informed choices for specific applications. Visual assessments alone prove inadequate; hence, our focus on the comprehensive exploration of tensile strength under various chemical conditions.
In essence, this multifaceted project contributes to understanding fiber characteristics and aids decision-making for optimal fiber choices in diverse contexts. The findings empower stakeholders to make discerning choices, ensuring fibers are matched with the most appropriate applications based on their performance in response to challenges posed by alkali and acid environments. 

## Scope and Limitation 

The aim of this experiment is to determine whether plant fibers under tension are stronger or weaker by calculating their tensile strength. The theoretical expectation is that the plant might show different tensile strength after submerging them in different solutions due to the affect on the molecules. However, there are limitations to consider. Fiber strands taken from the stem may vary in maturity, introducing potential strength variations, especially if sourced from different parts or plants of the same species. Within a single fiber, the diameter may differ along its length, with the end potentially having a thicker diameter than the middle. Additionally, the drying process may lead to over-drying, increasing brittleness and causing fibers to snap prematurely under minimal loads, potentially providing misleading indications of their actual tensile strength. 

The project aims to investigate the dependencies influencing the tensile strength of stone wool fibers and understand their fracture characteristics. These characters are: 

1. Production-related factors 
    1. Hyper quenching 
    2. Melting atmosphere 
    3. Fibers diameter 
    4. Applied axial tension during formation
2. Fibers surfaces characteristics
    1. Surface homogeneity
    2. Surface roughness 
    3. Surface reactivity 

Certainly, these factors display a notable correlation, a relationship that will be explored in the thesis overview and across the four associated articles. The mechanical performances of both continuous and discontinuous fibers will be examined, focusing on measuring their tensile strength in relation to varying production parameters. This investigation aims to provide valuable insights into the interconnected influences on fiber strength.

# Theory 

Depending upon the source, various fibers can be categorized as: 

1. Plant fiber (e.g. cotton and jute)
2. Animal fiber (e.g. silk and wool)
3. Synthetic fiber (e.g. nylon and polyester)

Natural fibers can be grouped based on where they come from. The plant-based category, like cotton, flax, and jute, comes from vegetables or cellulose. The animal-based group includes fibers from animals like wool, mohair, and silk. Another category is minerals, and a key example is asbestos. These fibers are derived from different sources and have various uses.

Vegetable fibers, like cotton, kapok, and coir, can be grouped based on where they come from in plants. For example, some fibers, such as cotton, grow as hairs on seeds or inner fruit walls, with each fiber being a long, narrow cell. Others, like flax and hemp, are called bast fibers and come from the inner tissue of certain plant stems, made up of overlapping cells. Fibers such as abaca and sisal come from the fibrovascular system of leaves.

Chemically, all these vegetable fibers are mostly made of cellulose, but they also have other substances like hemicellulose, lignin, pectins, and waxes that need to be removed or reduced during processing. Animal fibers, on the other hand, are made entirely of proteins. Except for silk, which is spun by moth larvae to make cocoons, animal fibers are essentially fur or hair that acts as a protective covering for animals.

Except for mineral fibers, all natural fibers really like water, whether it's in liquid or vapor form. This strong liking for water makes the fibers swell when they soak up water. This swelling is helpful when dyeing the fibers in watery solutions.

Unlike many man-made fibers, all-natural fibers don't change when heat is applied; they are what we call "nonthermoplastic." They don't get soft when heated, and at temperatures below the point where they break down, they don't really react much to dry heat. There's no shrinking or stretching when you heat them, and they don't become brittle if you cool them below freezing. However, natural fibers have a tendency to turn yellow when exposed to sunlight and moisture, and if they're exposed for a long time, they can lose some of their strength.

Natural fibers, like those from plants or animals, are prone to being broken down by tiny living things, such as bacteria and fungi. For plant-based fibers, this happens especially when it's humid and warm, and there's not much light. Even animal fibers like wool and silk can be broken down by bacteria and molds. Bugs like moths and carpet beetles can also harm animal fibers, while cellulose fibers can be attacked by termites and silverfish. However, this damage can be resisted by using certain chemicals.

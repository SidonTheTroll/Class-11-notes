# Qualitative Inorganic Analysis 

The investigation and recognition of substances is a crucial branch of chemistry, with analysts playing a vital role in various fields such as medicine, criminology, and the manufacturing industry. Qualitative inorganic analysis is a key aspect of this discipline, focusing on the identification of radicals present in inorganic salts or mixtures of salts. This process involves a series of systematic tests carried out in the correct order.

Inorganic salts are the result of the reaction between acids and bases. Each inorganic salt consists of two essential components: the part contributed by the acid is referred to as the acid radical or anion, while the part contributed by the base is known as the basic radical or cation. For example, in the case of sodium chloride, $Na^+$ represents the basic radical or cation, and $Cl^-$ is the acidic radical or anion.

Before commencing the testing of an inorganic substance, it is important to observe the substance's physical characteristics, such as its color and state. Additionally, determining its solubility in water is crucial. If the substance is soluble, further tests can be performed to determine if the solution is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. The color and solubility of an inorganic substance in water can provide valuable initial clues for identifying basic and acidic radicals.

Qualitative analysis of inorganic salts primarily involves the identification of cations and anions present in the salt or a mixture of salts. The tests carried out in this process, including wet tests and confirmatory tests, are conducted in a systematic manner. Preliminary examination of the solid salt and its solution provides important information that can simplify the subsequent analysis.

These preliminary tests, often known as dry tests, can be completed in a short period, typically within 10-15 minutes. They involve noting the general appearance and physical properties of the salt, including color, smell, and solubility. Dry tests encompass procedures such as heating the dry salt, blow pipe tests, flame tests, borax bead tests, sodium carbonate bead tests, and charcoal cavity tests.

Furthermore, the solubility of a salt in water and the $pH$ of its aqueous solutions offer critical insights into the nature of ions present in the salt. If a solution of the salt is found to be acidic or basic, it indicates hydrolysis in water. A basic solution may suggest the presence of carbonates or sulphides, while an acidic solution may indicate an acid salt or a salt of a weak base and strong acid. In the latter case, neutralizing the solution with sodium carbonate before testing for anions is recommened.

Additionally, gases evolved during the preliminary tests with dilute $H_2SO_4$, dilute $HCl$, and concentrated $H_2SO_4$ provide valuable indications about the presence of acid radicals. It is essential to conduct these preliminary tests before proceeding with the confirmatory tests for ions.

- The qualitative analysis of an inorganic substance is generally carried out in the following four parts: 
  1. Dry test for Basic Radicals 
  2. Dry test for Acidic Radicals 
  3. Wet test for anions (basic radicals)
  4. Wet test for cations (acidic radicals)

# Dry Test for Basic Radicals 

Perform this experiment by haeting a small amount of salt in a dry test tube.   
Information from this test can give valuable clues, partly from observation of the residue partly from identification of any gas evolved. Tabulate your observations along with the interferences that you can draw.

# Aim of the Experiment 

To study the effect of tensile strength of fiber for an acid and base. 

# Apparatus Required 

Hook, acid, base, different types of fibers, clamp, weight hanger, tweezer, slotted weight and clamp stand. 

# Theory 

Fibers which we see around us are of different kind like thin, long, thread, etc, polymers whicha and be woven intofabrics. The strong fibers possess strong intermolecular force of attraction which is formed between the chains. 

The fibers are of two types: 

1. **Natuarl fibers**: These fibers are originated in plants and animals. Animal fibers are mainly made up of proteins, while fibers of plants are usually made up of cellulose. 

2. **Synthetic fibers**: These are the fibers which are made by humans such as terylene, nylon, rayon, etc. The  sue of these fibers are continuously increasing because of economic factor and availability. 

On the bases of origination of fibers they are generated. Fibers are differentiated on the basis of their strength, propertiesa dn many more. The fibers should not loss its property that is it should not break the bond easily by the effect of air, water, base, acids this factor is called tensile strength of fibers. 

The strength of the fibers is called tensile strength. It can be say that tensile strength is defined as the extent ot which a fibers can be stretched without breaking.

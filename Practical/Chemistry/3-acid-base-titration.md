## Aim

To prepare Standard solution of oxalic acid and finding the molarity of the given sodium hydroxide solution. 

## Apparatus Required 

Conical flask, burette stand, 20 ml pipette

## Chemical Required

Sodium hydroxide solution, phenolphthalein indicator and oxalic acid. 

## Theory

The titration between oxalic acid and sodium hydroxide solution is carried out using phenolphthalein as an indicator. 

Sodium hydroxide is taken in burette and oxalic acid is taken in conical flask with the help of pipette it shows pink color. 

To prepare M/20 solution of Oxalic acid, the weight of oxalic acid required can be calculated by using the formula. 

$$
\text{Molarity = } \frac{W_b * 1000}{M_b * \text{volume in ml} } \quad\text{or} \quad W_b = \frac{\text{Molarity} * M_b * \text{volume in ml}}{1000}
$$

Where, $W_b$ = Whight of oxalic acid, $\qquad$ $M_b$ = Molecular mass of oxalic acid = 126 g/mol

Molarity = M/20 

$$
W_b = \frac{126 * 250}{20*1000} = 1.57 g 
$$
Wheght of Oxalic acid required = 1.57 g 

## Reaction involved 

**Molecular equation** = $\underset{|\underset{COOH}{}}{\text{COOH}}$ $\cdot$ $\text{NaOH}$ $\rightarrow$ $(\text{COONa})$ + $2\text{H}_2\text{O}$

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

No security required its only some markdown files.   
I remember from versions, feel free to go to any timeline of the code if you really want to.

The timeline is more like a time-machine to me. 

## Reporting an Vulnerability/Issue

Don't panic. Fork it, edit it, PR it.

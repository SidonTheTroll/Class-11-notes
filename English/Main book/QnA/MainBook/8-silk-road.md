### 1. What did the author notice in the vast open plains after leaving Ravu?

### 2. What sights did they encounter in the rocky wilderness?

### 3. How did the author react to the Tibetan Mastiff? 

As the author in the car got closer, the Tibetan mastiffs noticed them, cocked their big heads and locked their eyes. As the author got closer, they sprinted toward the vehicle like bullets, moving swiftly.

Tsetan halted the car and quickly got out to check the snowy road ahead. He wanted to assess if the surface was slippery and if their car could navigate through it.

### 5. Why did the author complain of headache? How did he get relief? 

The author, new to high-altitude climbing, developed a headache beyond 5,400 meters. Taking sips from the water bottle provided some relief.

### 6. Give a brief description of 'Hor'? 

'Hor' is a small town on the main east-west highway that followed the old trade route from Lhasa to Kashmir. Located on the shore Lake Manasarovar, it is a small, grim place with no vegetation scattered with years of accumulated trash.

### 8. What activities were going on the dry lake on the other side of the pass?

### 10. Why is lake Manasarovar Tibet's most venerated stretch of water? 

Lake Manasarovar is considered Tibet's most venerated stretch of water because ancient Hindu nad Buddhist cosmologists pinpoint it to be the source of four great Indian rivers. 

### 11. What sort of experience did the author had at Darchen? 

The author was dissatisfied with Darchen due to health issues caused by the high altitude, including a bad cold and difficulty sleeping. As one of the early arrivals, the lack of pilgrims made the place less vibrant. Darchen appeared dusty, partially run-down, marked by heaps of rubble and scattered refuse.

### 12. Why did the night at the guest house at Darchen turn out to be another troubled one? 

After 10:30 pm, they opted to stay in a guest house in Darchen, which proved to be a challenging night. The nearby rubbish dump in Hor aggravated his cold, and even herbal tea provided no relief. Lying on the bed, one of his nostrils was blocked, and feeling deprived of sufficient oxygen, he checked his watch.

### 13. How does the author recount his experience at the Darchen Medical College? 

In Darchen, the author had a troubling night, catching a cold with blocked nostrils, making breathing difficult. Hungry and fatigued, he struggled to sleep, waking abruptly with a heaviness in his chest.

The author didn't personally witness it, but he was informed that during the pilgrimage season, Darchen was bustling with visitors. Many brought their own accommodations, setting up tents at the outskirts of Darchen that extended across the plains.

### 15. What did the author learn about Norbu? How did he feel? 

Norbu, a Tibetan working at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, came to perform the 'Kora' at Kailash. Despite writing academic papers on its significance in Buddhist literature, he had never done the Kora himself. The author, delighted, looked forward to doing the Kora together with Norbu.

### 16. Did the author stick to his original plan to make the trek? Give a reason for your answer. 

The author deviated from his initial plan, which involved trekking with devout believers. Despite Norbu not being a practicing Buddhist, his enthusiasm convinced the author. After careful consideration, the author decided that Norbu would be an ideal companion.

### 17. What options did the author had after Tsetan left? 

He waited for fellow pilgrims since he didn't want to traverse the route alone, uncertain about snow blockages. Finding no English speaker, he couldn't confirm if the snow had cleared.

### 18. What qualities of Norbu do you think made him an ideal companion to the author?

Norbu, an educated Tibetan fluent in English, was enthusiastic about the Kailash Kora. Practical, he suggested hiring yaks for luggage, and his humor extended to laughing at his own shortcomings.

# Long Answer Questions 

### The author on his way to Mt. Kailash came across a lot of topography variations. Comment. 

The author and his companions took a shortcut to get off the Changtang. Tsetan knew a route that would take them south-west, almost crossing several fairly high mountain passes. From the gently raising hills of Ravu, the shortcut took them across vast open plains with nothing except a few gazells that were grazing in the arid pastures. Further ahead, the plains became more stony than grassy.  
The hills ahead became steeper where the solitary drokbas were tending their flocks. This led them to the snow capped mountains and then to the valley, where the river was wide and clogged with ice. At the height of 5515 meters, piles of stone marked the landscape. Next was the plateau, which was covered with salty desert area and salty lakes that were the remnants of the Tethys sea. Then, Hor was next in line. It was a grim and miserable place with no vegetation and years of accumulated trash scattered liberally. The next and the last stop was Darchen. The author noticed that the people were very relaxed and unhurry, but there was a significant drawback- there were no pilgrims in Darchen.

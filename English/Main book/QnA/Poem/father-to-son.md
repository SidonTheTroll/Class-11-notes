### 1. What does the speaker say about the father-son relationship? 

The relationship between the father and son doesn't work well. The father doesn't get what the son wants or desires. They talk like they don't know each other, and when they do talk, it leads to disagreements. Otherwise, there is a noticeable lack of communication between them, and silence often fills the space.

### 2. What do you think is responsible for the distance between father and son? 

The problem comes from the older generation, like the father, not really understanding things. The father wants his son to stay close to home, but the son, who's now a young man, is looking for new opportunities and living in his own world. The father is having a tough time adjusting to these changes.

### 3. Why do you think, does the father appear so helpless? 

The father doesn't grasp what his son enjoys doing. He can't really give him advice because they don't share a close bond. They talk like they don't know each other, and most of the time, it's just quiet between them. The son has his own dreams and plans, but the father doesn't seem to understand or value them.

### 4. How can you infer that the father wishes his son to remain at home with him? 

The father sees his son's interests as very different. The father prefers staying at home, while the son is eager to explore new opportunities. The son dreams of having his own world. The father wishes his son would come back home, even if it means facing losses from his adventurous pursuits. The father is ready to reconcile if the son agrees to live with him.

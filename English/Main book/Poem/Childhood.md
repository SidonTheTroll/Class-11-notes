## What did the speaker learn about the existance of heaven and hell? 

## How did the speaker realize the hypocracy of the adults? 

## How did the realization of being the master of his own mind helped him? 

## The poet has asked two quesitons. One is about the time nad the other is aboutthe place. Why has he used these questions? 

## Which do you think are the most poetic lines? Why? 

The last three lines: "It went to some forgotten place, That's hidden in an infant's face, That's all I know." are the most poetic lines in the poem.  
It is because these lines beautifully sum up the process of growth and the disappearanc of a particular stage of life.

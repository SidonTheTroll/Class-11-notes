### Q/ You are Amit/Amrita. You have to write a debate on the topic, "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Good morning, everyone! 
Respected Jury and my dear opponent friends. Today I'm here to speak against the motion on the topic "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Coaching classes have been a phenomenon since the past but recently have been booming in today's day and age. But this has been used by today's teachers/coaches in order to make money. Nonetheless, there are still good teachers which provide honest coaching for the students. But this has been used by school teachers to provide an upper hand for their favored students and also on their side by asking extra fees for notes. It is common in the institutions where teachers are getting low salary and competititon among students is high. Theses unfair practices should be stopped and the students must opt for free and accesible resources so that the level stays the same and its the self-creativity of the students that will give them equal perks on self-studying. 

Thank you.

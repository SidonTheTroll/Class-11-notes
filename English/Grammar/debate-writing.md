### Q/ You are Amit/Amrita. You have to write a debate on the topic, "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Good morning, everyone!  
Respected Jury and my dear opponent friends. Today I'm here to speak against the motion on the topic "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Coaching classes have been a phenomenon since the past but recently have been booming in today's day and age. But this has been used by today's teachers/coaches in order to make money. Nonetheless, there are still good teachers which provide honest coaching for the students. But this has been used by school teachers to provide an upper hand for their favored students and also on their side by asking extra fees for notes. It is common in the institutions where teachers are getting low salary and competititon among students is high. Theses unfair practices should be stopped and the students must opt for free and accesible resources so that the level stays the same and its the self-creativity of the students that will give them equal perks on self-studying. 

Thank you.

### Q/ Write a debate for or against the motion in 150 words on the topic "Success in life is more important than happiness in life."

Good morning, everyone!  
Respected Jury and my dear opponent friends. Today I'm here to speak for the motion on the topic "Success is life is more important than happiness in life."

We all have been hearing and reading about the valor and success of many hitorical figures. We are expected by the society to do something for it. Even our parents expect us to be successful in our studies. Their happiness is our happiness and we must make them happy by our success in order to be more successful in life and climb the social ladder. Our stories will resonate the in the tell-tales of the future and will shape the world around us. This all will result in self gratitude and satisfaction of ourselves that we did something in life. 

Therefore in conclusion, I'd like to say that happiness and success are interrelated. A person can be happy by doing nothing in life but our contribution and the resulting success will give us a feeling of self satisfaction among the emptiness in our heart. 

Thank you.

### Q/ You are Amit/Amrita. You have to write a debate on the topic, "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Good morning, everyone!  
Respected Jury and my dear opponent friends. Today I'm here to speak against the motion on the topic "Coaching classes are a necessity for today's students."

Coaching classes have been a phenomenon since the past but recently have been booming in today's day and age. But this has been used by today's teachers/coaches in order to make money. Nonetheless, there are still good teachers which provide honest coaching for the students. But this has been used by school teachers to provide an upper hand for their favored students and also on their side by asking extra fees for notes. It is common in the institutions where teachers are getting low salary and competititon among students is high. Theses unfair practices should be stopped and the students must opt for free and accesible resources so that the level stays the same and its the self-creativity of the students that will give them equal perks on self-studying. 

Thank you.

### Q/ Write a debate for or against the motion in 150 words on the topic "Success in life is more important than happiness in life."

Good morning, everyone!  
Respected Jury and my dear opponent friends. Today I'm here to speak for the motion on the topic "Success is life is more important than happiness in life."

We all have been hearing and reading about the valor and success of many hitorical figures. We are expected by the society to do something for it. Even our parents expect us to be successful in our studies. Their happiness is our happiness and we must make them happy by our success in order to be more successful in life and climb the social ladder. Our stories will resonate the in the tell-tales of the future and will shape the world around us. This all will result in self gratitude and satisfaction of ourselves that we did something in life. 

Therefore in conclusion, I'd like to say that happiness and success are interrelated. A person can be happy by doing nothing in life but our contribution and the resulting success will give us a feeling of self satisfaction among the emptiness in our heart. 

Thank you.

### Write a debate on the topic, "Should firecrackers be banned in Diwali" in about 120-150 words. 

Good afternoon, everyone! Respected jury and my dear opponents, today I'm here to speak against the motion on the topic "Should firecrackers be banned during Diwali."

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, holds a special place in our hearts, and firecrackers have evolved to become an integral part of modern society's celebrations. People not only burst firecrackers but also decorate their houses with earthen lamps and lights. Historically, it is a significant aspect of Hindu culture. However, the pollution caused by the bursting of firecrackers has raised significant concerns due to the fumes they produce. Consequently, the government has wielded its authority to ban the use of firecrackers during this festival as they see fit.

Nevertheless, it is practically impossible to completely ban firecrackers, as people will inevitably find ways to acquire and use them. Rather than an outright ban, I argue that people should exercise self-awareness and restraint as they mature. At the very least, children should be allowed to have some fun during this festive season, and the usage of firecrackers should be controlled and regulated, rather than being banned at a central level. It is important to recognize that aside from firecrackers, other sources of pollution, such as factory emissions and agricultural residue (known as 'farali'), should also be controlled and properly managed.

In conclusion, it is essential to acknowledge that firecrackers are not the sole culprits in the environmental concerns associated with Diwali. The government should focus on regulating other contributing factors such as excessive car usage and improper waste disposal. The culture surrounding Diwali has evolved to the point where firecrackers have become inseparable from the festivities, and even if the government were to ban them, people would undoubtedly find ways to circumvent such restrictions.

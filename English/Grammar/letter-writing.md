Thought the columns of your esteemed local daily, I would like to draw your kind attention towards the problem of erratic power supply in our locality. 
    In these days, it had been observed that there is irregular power supply in and around Noida and this is creating a massive problem to the residents. Students are having problem to study at night, households are facing inconvenience to do their chores and also most importantly, due to irregular power supply, this has caused a road accident in my locality and people are not feeling safe inside their houses as the absence of electricity helps robbers and thieves to hide in the dark.
Therefore, I would like to urge the concerned authorities to look up to the problem and fix it as soon as possible. Your cooperation will be very grateful for all the people residing in Noida.

Sir 
Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I would like to highlight the issue of theft, robbery and eve-teasing in our locality. 

Since a few weeks, it has been a debated topic in our locality about the incidents of unacceptable activities of theft, robbery and eve-teasing. Many people were harmed and few even got death threats in broad daylight and even inside their house. Such dishonest activities are truly unacceptable in the society.

Therefore, I request you to look into the matter and assign the concerned authorities to investigate in the issue as soon as possible. Your cooperation would be very greatful for all the people in the locality. 

Thanking you 

Your truly

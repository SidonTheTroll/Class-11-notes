**1st gen**: 1946-58 - machine language - vacuum tubes - ENIAC, UNIAC   
**2nd gen**: 1959-64 - Assembly language (Mnemonic code (Assembler)) - Transistors - IBM140, IBM1401  
**3rd gen**: 1965-70 - High-level language (compiler/interpreter) - integrated circuit - IBM360  
**4th gen**: 1971-present - high-level language - microprocessor - Apple 


- The fifth generation is considered to be powered by AI with the help of natural language (the language that we use to talk with other humans)
  - **Disadvantages**: AI can demolish all creative ideas.

**Burning**: storing to CD   
**Ripping**: fetching from CD

# System/Application software

- System software is compulsory 

> Application software is case-based. 

**System software**: Operating system, Language processor, System utilities, and device drivers

> Operating system gives a platform for the user to interact with the software. 

1995 - Windows 95 


# Language Processor 

Translates the code into machine code. 

- Types: 
  - Assembler.
  - Interpreter.
  - Compiler

# System utilities

System utilities are *software programs or tools* designed to assist in **managing, optimizing, and maintaining** a computer system. These utilities perform various tasks related to **system management, troubleshooting, security, and performance enhancement**. 

- Here are some examples of common system utilities:
  - **Antivirus Software**: These utilities protect your computer from malicious software such as *viruses, malware, and spyware* by scanning and removing them.
  - **Disk Cleanup**: It helps to free up disk space by removing *temporary files, system caches, and unnecessary files* from the computer.
  - **Disk Defragmenter**: This utility *rearranges fragmented files* on a hard drive, **improving access speed and overall system performance**.
  - **Backup and Recovery Tools**: These utilities create *backups of important files and folders* and provide options for recovering data *in case of system failures or accidental deletions*.
  - **Task Manager**: It allows the user to *monitor and manage running processes, applications, and system performance*. Unresponsive tasks or applications can be killed with the help of task manager.
  - **Disk Partitioning Tools**: These utilities enable you to *divide a hard drive into multiple partitions*, **allowing for better organization and management of data**.
  - **Device Manager**: It *displays information* about the *hardware devices installed on the computer* and allows you to *update or troubleshoot device drivers*.
  - **Registry Cleaner**: This utility *scans and cleans the Windows registry*, **removing invalid entries** and **optimizing the system's performance**.
  - **Firewall**: A firewall utility *monitors network traffic* and ***protects the computer from unauthorized access and external threats***.
  - **System Information Tools**: These utilities *provide detailed information about the hardware and software configuration* of computer, including the *CPU, RAM, storage devices, and installed software*.
  - **Uninstaller**: It helps you *remove unwanted programs* from your computer cleanly, ensuring that all associated files and registry entries are deleted.
  - **File Compression Tools**: These utilities *compress files and folders into smaller sizes*, saving disk space and making it easier to transfer or share files.

# Devices Drivers 

**Device drivers** are software programs that allow the operating system to *communicate and interact with hardware devices* connected to a computer. They act as a *bridge between the hardware and the operating system*, enabling the OS to control and utilize the functionality of various devices.

When a new hardware device is installed, the operating system needs to recognize and understand how to communicate with that device. This is where device drivers come into play. *Device drivers provide the necessary instructions and protocols for the operating system to interact with the device effectively*.

- Here are a few examples of device drivers:
  - **Display Driver**: Also known as a ***graphics driver***, it allows the operating system to ***communicate with the graphics card or integrated graphics chipset***. Display drivers are responsible for ***rendering and displaying images on the monitor***, controlling screen resolutions, and enabling features like hardware acceleration.
  - **Printer Driver**: This driver enables the operating system to ***communicate with a printer***, sending print jobs and controlling various printing settings such as print quality, paper size, and orientation.
  - **Network Adapter Driver**: It allows the operating system to ***interact with network interface cards*** (NICs) ***or wireless adapters***. The driver enables the OS to *establish network connections*, *manage network settings, and transmit/receive data over the network*.
  - **Sound Card Driver**: This driver enables the operating system to ***utilize the capabilities of a sound card***, *allowing **audio playback, recording, and controlling sound settings***.
  - **Keyboard and Mouse Drivers**: These drivers facilitate the *communication between the operating system and the keyboard and mouse devices*, translating input from these peripherals into commands that the system can understand.
  - **Scanner Driver**: It enables the operating system to *control and interact with a scanner*, *facilitating the scanning of documents or images and transferring the data to the computer*.
  - **USB Driver**: USB drivers are responsible for *managing USB ports and devices connected to them*. They allow the operating system to *detect and use USB devices* like external hard drives, flash drives, cameras, and more.

*Device drivers are specific to each hardware device and operating system*. Manufacturers provide driver software to ensure **compatibility and proper functioning** of their devices with different operating systems. It's essential to keep device drivers up to date to ensure optimal performance, stability, and compatibility with the latest software and hardware advancements.

> The problem with old computers was that the user can only use peripherals of the same company that made the device.

# Introduction 

The speed at which technology is advancing is astonishing. It's changing our lives in ways we couldn't have predicted decades ago. Now, you can control things like listening to the news or playing music with just your voice. Online stores even suggest products that match your preferences, which can be really surprising and convenient. All of this is thanks to modern technology.

# Artificial Intelligence. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computers to learn by adjusting it to the latest things just like a human being. 

- They usually run on algorithms. 

It brings out the following things: 

1. It can mimic human thoughts and behavior (learning from mistakes, catching new ideas, etc)
2. It acts in a very human like way: intelligent, rational and ethical (take decision in a right way)

More the data is fed to the AI, the better results it will give. 

Therefore they are designed and programmed to: 

1. Work with minimum human intervention.
2. Create and update knowledge base, which keeps updating. 
3. Having heuristic abilities (learn from past mistakes, decisions and outcomes)

The most famous example of AI is the **Social Humanoid robot Sophia**, who has the citizenship of Saudi Arabia. 

Common examples of AI: 

- Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
- Smart home devices like Google's NEST.
- Self driving cars like TESLA S, 3, X, Y 
- AI game NPCs like in Alien: Isolation. 

It is predicted that AI will grow rapidly in the coming 5 to 10 years as of writing. It will be able to surpass human tasks such as Translating languages, wtriting school essays, driving trucks, etc. However complex tasks such as surgery will take more years for machines to learn. 

## Immersive Experience with Extended Reality (XR)

Extended Reality is an embrella term which covers various technologies that enhances our senses and gives us immersive experience. It includes technologies like **Virtual Reality** (VR), **Augmented Reality** (AR), Mixed Reality, etc. 

### Virtual Reality (VR)

Virtual Reality is where with an environment is simulated with the help of computers and with the help of VR devices, the user can see and feel things in a compter generated environment. 

It makes possible for the user to interact with the virtual environment with multiple senses; this is called **sensory synchronicity**.

VR is made possible by devices like VR Headset, instrumented and sensory gloves and VR bodysuit. 

#### Example uses 

1. Participating in sports while not being in the environment to do so. 
2. Military training such as flying or combat simulators. 
3. Medical trainings or surgeries remotely. 

## Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that blends digital information, such as computer-generated graphics or data, with the real-world environment. AR provides users with an enhanced perception of their physical surroundings by overlaying digital content onto it, typically through a display device like a smartphone, tablet, or AR headset. 

This digital information can include 3D models, text, images, or other multimedia elements, which are integrated in real-time and appear as if they coexist with the physical world.

AR can also work in coordination with other sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, digital compass, GPS, CPU, etc.

## Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality 

| <center> Aspect                 | <center> Augmented Reality (AR)          | <center> Virtual Reality (VR)               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Environment            | Augments the real world with digital content. | Immerses users in a completely virtual environment. |
| Interaction with Reality | Allows users to interact with the real world while overlaying digital elements. | Isolates users from the real world, creating a fully immersive digital environment. |
| Display Device         | Typically used with devices like smartphones, tablets, or AR headsets. | Requires dedicated VR headsets or goggles for a full VR experience. |
| Use Cases              | Diverse applications, including gaming, navigation, education, training, and more. | Primarily used for gaming, simulations, training, and immersive experiences. |
| Level of Immersion     | Offers a lower level of immersion as it retains a connection to the real world. | Offers a high level of immersion by isolating users from their surroundings. |
| Real-World Awareness   | Users remain aware of their real-world surroundings while using AR. | Users are disconnected from the real world and have limited awareness of it. |
| Examples               | Pok√©mon Go, AR navigation apps, AR educational tools. | VR gaming (e.g., Oculus Rift), VR simulations, VR training. |

## Mixed Reality (MR)

Mixed Reality (MR) seamlessly combines elements of the real world and the virtual world. It integrates digital content into the physical environment, allowing users to interact with both. 

MR is dynamic, spatially aware, and exists on a spectrum between Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). 

Example use cases: gaming, education, healthcare, etc. 

# Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning means the ability of computers to independently find solutions to problems by learning from the past activity thus incraesing performance.  
This is generally obtained by recognizing patterns in databases using statistical techniques. 

It enables the computer to recognize patterns based on specific algorithms called models and datasets to develop adequate solution concepts. 

## How ML Works 

Machine learning works by inputing huge amount of data through testing and training, specific algorithms and models enable the computer to learn like a human being by identifying patterns and distinguishing between them.  

Ml applications are developed from experience (data) like humans without direct programming, and these applications learn, grow, change and develop by themselves.

Examples: face recognition, reverse image search, voice assistants, chatbots, etc. 

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is the field in machine learning which helps the computer understant, interpret and matipulate human language for execution and give the output in a human language. 

Examples: spell check, autocomplete, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, language translation, question/answering, etc. 

# Robotics 

It is a branch of technology that deals with the conception, design, manufacture and operation of physical robots. 

- Robots are autonomous or semi-autonomous machines that could 
    - Interact with the physical world via sensors and actuators (devices that move the joints)
    - Be programmed 

# Big Data 

Big data is the term used for extermely large datasets that cannot be handled with traditional database applications. It refers to the size and complexity of datasets. Its unstructured nature makes it difficult to analyze. 

## Characteristics of Big Data 

### Volume 

It refers to the extermely large amount of data that is created. It is hard to store all the data in a conventional database and on a conventional hard drive in a server. The data has to be stored across multiple servers composed of thousands of hard drives. 

### Variety 

It refers to the number of types of data generated. Along with traditional datatypes (text, integer, boolean, etc), unstructured datatypes (photographs, videos,likes, comments, messages, audio, etc) are also stored. 

### Velocity 

It is the measure of how fast the data is received.

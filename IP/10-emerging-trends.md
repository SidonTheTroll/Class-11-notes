# Introduction 

The speed at which technology is advancing is astonishing. It's changing our lives in ways we couldn't have predicted decades ago. Now, you can control things like listening to the news or playing music with just your voice. Online stores even suggest products that match your preferences, which can be really surprising and convenient. All of this is thanks to modern technology.

# Artificial Intelligence. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computers to learn by adjusting it to the latest things just like a human being. 

- They usually run on algorithms. 

It brings out the following things: 

1. It can mimic human thoughts and behavior (learning from mistakes, catching new ideas, etc)
2. It acts in a very human like way: intelligent, rational and ethical (take decision in a right way)

More the data is fed to the AI, the better results it will give. 

Therefore they are designed and programmed to: 

1. Work with minimum human intervention.
2. Create and update knowledge base, which keeps updating. 
3. Having heuristic abilities (learn from past mistakes, decisions and outcomes)

The most famous example of AI is the **Social Humanoid robot Sophia**, who has the citizenship of Saudi Arabia. 

Common examples of AI: 

- Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
- Smart home devices like Google's NEST.
- Self driving cars like TESLA S, 3, X, Y 
- AI game NPCs like in Alien: Isolation. 

It is predicted that AI will grow rapidly in the coming 5 to 10 years as of writing. It will be able to surpass human tasks such as Translating languages, wtriting school essays, driving trucks, etc. However complex tasks such as surgery will take more years for machines to learn.

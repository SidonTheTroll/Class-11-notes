Data stored in variables is called data. 

Types:
	numbers, string, list, tuple, dictionary 

Numbers: variables stored as numbers 

Data type: 
	Numbers: 
		Integer 
			integer 
			boolean 
		float = decimal values 
		Complex = 3 + 12.45J 

	String (Word, character, sentence, paragraph) 

	Variable 

	
#Python's variables are lables

Variables are assigned and can be changed too without changing the value.

Datatypes:
	Character: stores letters, characters, symbols 
	Integer: stores whole numbers
	String: stores words, sentences and numbers 
	Float: Stores decimals 
	Boolean: True or False 

Python by default stores input values as strings. 

a = 2		|	a = 2 
b = 3 		|	b = 3.5
c = a + b 	|	c = a + b 
# c = 5 	|	# c = 6.5 


Python always follows hierarchy

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))	# 3.2 -> 3 

n = float(input("Enter a number: ")) # 7 -> 7.0 

Disadvantages of float datatypes: 
(i) It is slower than integer operations 
(ii) After decimal point the maximum digits accepted is 15. 

• In string datatype the address lines starts from zero 

0	1	2	3 	   -> Forward indexing
R 	A 	M 	A
-4	-3	-2	-1 	   -> Backward indexing 

>> x[0]
'R'

>> x[-4]
'R'

Forward indexing starts from 0 
Backward indexing ends with -1 

Lists, Tuples and Dictionary 

• List and tuple are used to store multiple items in one variable 

> List offers flexibility for modification
> Tuples provide immutability and has fixed collection for values 

list = [1, 2, 3]
tuple = (1, 2, 3)

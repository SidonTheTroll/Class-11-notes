#### Getting Started with Python

##### Planning - Algorithm or Flow Chart

**Algorithm**

Project: write a program that adds 2 numbers

1. Start
2. Take two numbers from the user.
3. Add them
4. Print the sum
5. Stop

Flow chart is just a pictorial representation of the data above.

C is the most common programming language.

ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network) was made to share military documents among US defense officials.

Combining languages is not counted as a new language.

Base Languages of Python: ABC, Modula 3

**Advantages:**
- Easy to use
- Expressive
- Fewer lines of code
- Lower number of syntaxes
- Interpreted language
- Cross-platform language
- Free and open-source
- Variety of uses

**Disadvantages:**
- Not fast
- Less libraries than C and Java
- Dynamic nature is vulnerable to security issues
- Cannot be compiled into a standalone executable
- More chances of bugs in the code
- More memory usage

Library package: toolkits to implement in the code to increase functionality easily along with saving time.

### Installing Python in Windows

1. Go to the official website of Python at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click on the "Download Python" button.

2. Choose the latest version of Python and select the appropriate Windows installer (either 32-bit or 64-bit) based on your system configuration.

3. Once the installer is downloaded, run the executable file to start the installation process.

4. In the installation wizard, select "Add Python to PATH" and click on "Customize installation" to choose the installation location and additional features.

5. Select the features you want to install and click "Next".

6. Choose the installation location and click "Install".

7. The installation process will begin, and it may take several minutes to complete.

8. Once the installation is complete, you can open the command prompt or PowerShell and type "python" to check if Python is installed correctly.

9. Alternatively, you can also run the IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) that comes with Python to write and run Python programs.

Python is pre-installed in Linux for a barebones installation, the following steps will install Python:

1. Open the terminal and type "sudo <package manager syntax + appropriate flags> python3".

2. Enter the password and enter 'y' when the package manager asks for action.

3. When done, type 'python3' in the terminal.

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single GUI.

**Advantages of using an IDE:**
- Code editing automation
- Syntax highlighting
- Intelligent code completion
- Local build automation
- Compilation
- Testing
- Debugging

A Python file ends with the extension '.py'.

**Examples of Python IDEs:**
- PyCharm: PyCharm is a popular cross-platform IDE developed by JetBrains. It provides advanced features such as code completion, debugging, and version control integration.
- Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful cross-platform IDE developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for Python, as well as many other programming languages.
- Spyder: Spyder is an open-source IDE specifically designed for scientific computing and data analysis with Python. It has a user-friendly interface and provides many features for data visualization and analysis.
- IDLE: IDLE is the official Python IDE that comes with the standard Python distribution. It provides basic features such as code editing, debugging, and execution.
- Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- Sublime Text: Sublime Text is a lightweight text editor with powerful features and support for many programming languages, including Python. It has a large user community and many plugins and extensions available.
- Atom: Atom is another lightweight text editor with support for many programming languages, including Python. It has a user-friendly interface and many plugins and extensions available.

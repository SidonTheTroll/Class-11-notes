# Thermal Properties of Solids 

**Heat**: It is a form of energy which produces in us the sensation of warmth or coldness.  
Heat is energy in transit that flows from one body to another due to temperature difference. 

## Dynamic Theory of Heat 

Heat is the energy produced due to molecular motion and is equal to the sum total of kinetic energy possessed by molecules due to translational, rotational and vibrational motion. 

**Si unit**: Joule  
**CGS unit**: Calorie

**1 calorie**: It is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of $1g$ of water by $1\degree C$.

1 cal = 4.186 J 

# Temperature 

It is the measure of degree of nothess or coldness.  
The temperature of a body decides the direction of flow of heat when two bodies are in contact.

The temperature of a body is the measure of average kinetic energy of its molecules. 

**SI unit**: Kelvin $(K)$

# Conversion of Temperature from One Scale to Another 

$\frac{\text{Temperature in one scale - Lower fixed point}}{\text{Higher fixed point - Lower fixed point}}$

$\implies \frac{\text{Temperature on anothre scale - Lower fixed point}}{\text{Higher fixed point - Lower fixed point}}$

- $T_C$
  - Boiling point of water: $100\degree C$
  - Melting point of water: $0\degree C$
- $T_F$
  - Boiling point of water: $212\degree F$
  - Melting point of water: $32\degree F$
- $T_K$
  - Boiling point of water: $373.15 K$
  - Melting point of water: $273.15 K$

$\frac{T_C-C}{100-0} = \frac{T_F-32}{212-32}=\frac{T_K-273.15}{373.15-273.15}$  

$\frac{T_C}{100}=\frac{T_F-32}{180}=\frac{T_K-273.15}{100}$

$T_F=\frac{9}{5}+32$

# Absolute Scale of Water 

Liquid in glass thermometer shows different readings for temperature other than fixed point because of different expansion properties.  
However, experiment shows that thermometer that uses gas shows same expansion property at low density, when same quantity of gas is used. The factor which describes the behavior of given mass of gas are pressure, temperature and volume. And these properties of gas can be expressed by using two laws.

1. **Charles' law**: here pressure remains constant

$\frac{V}{T} = const$

2. **Boyle's law**: here temperature remains constant 

$PV = const$

Combining both relations we get, 


$\frac{PV}{T}=const$  
$\implies PV = const \times T$  
$\implies PV = \mu RT = nRT$

Here $\mu \text{ or } n$ = number of moles of gas  
$R$ = universal gas constant  
$R = 8.314 J mol^{-1}K^{-1}$

From this equation,

<img align=right width=400 src="src/thermal-properties-of-solids/pressure-temperature-graph.png">

$PV \propto T$

IF volumes is constant, 

$P \propto T$

# Thermal Expansion 

Almost all matter expand on heating. 

- Types 
  1. **Linear expansion**: increase in length
  2. **Superficial/surface arial expansion**: increase in surface area 
  3. **Cubical/volumetric expansion**: Increase in volume 

As temperature increases, vibration increases as well as inter-molecular space. 

## Linear Expansion 

$\Delta L\propto \Delta T$  
$\Delta L\propto L$

- Here, 
  - $\Delta L$ = change in length 
  - $\Delta T$ = change in temperature
  - $L$ = total length 

$\therefore \Delta L \propto L\Delta T$

or $\Delta L = \alpha_l L\Delta T$  
or $\Delta L = \alpha L\Delta T$

$\alpha_l$ or $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion. Varies for different material. 

## Arial Expansion 

$\Delta A \propto \Delta T$  
$\Delta A \propto A$  
$\Delta A \propto A\Delta T$

$\implies \Delta A =\alpha_A A\Delta T$  
or $\Delta A = \beta A\Delta T$

$\beta$ = coefficient of arial expansion 

## Volumetric Expansion

$\Delta L \propto \Delta T$  
$\Delta L \propto V$

$\implies \Delta L \propto V\Delta T$

$\implies \Delta A=\alpha_v\Delta V\Delta T$  
$\implies \Delta A=\gamma V\Delta T$

**SI unit of $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$**: $[K^{-1}]$ 

> We know, $\gamma = \frac{\Delta V}{V\Delta T}$  
> So it can be said that $\gamma$ is not independent of $\Delta T$. However for solid and liquid,it is noticed that $\gamma$ becomes almost constant at high temperatures.

# Relationship between $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$

## Between $\alpha$ and $\beta$

Let $dA$ be the change in area of a 2D square metal sheet when temperature is changed by $dT$. Under this condition, 

$dA = \beta AdT$ ------$\frak{1}$

But,  
$A = l^2 [l \text{ is the size of square sheet}]$

Differentiating we get, 

$dA =2ldl$----- $\frak{2}$

From eq. $\frak{1}$ and $\frak{2}$,

$2ldl = \beta Adt$------$\frak{3}$

But,  
$dl=\alpha ldT$

Putting this value in eq. $\frak{3}$,

$2l \times \alpha ldT = \beta AdT$  
$2l^2\alpha dT = \beta l^2 dT$  
$\implies 2\alpha=\beta$  
or $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{2}$

## Relationship between $\alpha$ and $\gamma$

Let $dv$ be the increasing volume where $dt$ temperature is increased for a cube side $l$ 

$\therefore dv=\gamma VdT$ ------$\frak{1}$

But,  
$v =l^3$  
$dv=3l^2dl$-------$\frak{2}$

From eq. $\frak{1}$ and $\frak{2}$

$3l^2dl = \gamma VdT$ -------$\frak{3}$

But,  
$dl=\alpha ldT$

Butting this in eq. $\frak{3}$

$3l62\alpha ldT=\gamma VdT$  
$\implies 3l^3\alpha=\gamma V$  
$\implies 3l^3\alpha = \gamma l^3$  
$\implies 3\alpha = \gamma$  
$\implies \alpha=\frac{\gamma}{3}$ 

$\therefore \alpha =\frac{\beta}{2}=\frac{\gamma}{3}$

# Anamolus Expansion of Water 

Almost all substance expants on heating but water behaves in a peculiar way. When at $0\degree C$ and water is heated, its volume decreases till the temperature of water reaches $4\degree C$. On further increases in temperature, the bolume again increases as shown. 

<img width=400 src="src/thermal-properties-of-solids/water-expansion-graph.png">

# Effect of Temperature on Density of Liquid 

We know, 

$\text{Density}=\frac{mass}{volume}$-------$\frak{1}$

If we increase the temperature by $dT$ amoutn, the volume decreases by $dv$. 

$\therefore \rho'=\frac{M}{vdv}$------$\frak{2}$

Dividing eq. $\frak{2}$ by $\frak{1}$

$\frac{\rho'}{\rho}=\frac{v}{v+dv}=\frac{v}{v+\gamma vdT}$  
$\implies \frac{\rho'}{\rho}\frac{1}{1+\gamma dT}$  
$\implies \frac{\rho'}{\rho}=(1+\gamma dT)^{-1}$

Expanding binomially,

$\frac{\rho'}{\rho}=(1-\gamma dT)$  
$\implies \rho'=\rho(1-\gamma dT)$

This equation shows if temperature increases, density decreases and vice versa. 

# Coefficient of Volume Expansion of Ideal Gas with Temperature 

We know Ideal Gas equation is $PV = nRT$-----$\frak{1}$

The coefficient of volume expansion of liquid and solid are relatively independent of temperature andbu tfor ideal gas it is dependetn on temperature. 

Now differentiating eq. $\frak{1}$

$d(PV)=d(nRT)$  
$Pdv=nrd(T)$ [Pressure, n and R are constant]

Dividing eq. $\frak{1}$ and $\frak{2}$

$\frac{v}{dv}=\frac{T}{dT}$  
$\implies \frac{vdT}{dv}=T$  
$\frac{vdT}{\gamma vdT}=T$  
$\frac{1}{\gamma}=T$  
$\gamma = \frac{1}{T}$

# Specific Heat Capacity (c)


$Q \propto \Delta T$  
$q \propto m$  
$Q\propto m\Delta T$  
$\implies Q=cm\Delta T$

- Here,
  - $Q$: amount of heat supplied
  - $m$: mass of substance 
  - $\Delta T$: change in temperature
  - $c$: specific heat capacity of a substance 

> Specific heat capacity depends on the nature of the substance 

$\therefore c=\frac{Q}{m\Delta T}$

Specific heat is defined as thee quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unti mass of substance by $1\degree C$ or $1\degree K$

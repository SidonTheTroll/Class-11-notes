# Elasitc and Plastic Behavior of Solid 

**Elasitc**: The material returns to its original shape and size when external forces aer removed due to molecular distortions.  
**Plastic**: Irreversable deformation resulting in permanent change in the material's atomic structure.  
**Deforming force**: A force which can change the shape and size of a body on which it is applied is called deforming force.  
**Elasticity**: Property of a solid to return to its original shape.  
**Perfectly Elasitc Body:** If a body regains it original shape and size immediately after removal of deforming foce, the body is said to be perfectly elasitc. Eg: quartz.  
**Plasticity:** Tendency of a body to go permanent, non-reversable deformation without fracturing when subjected to external forces. 
**Perfectly Plastic Body:** it is a material which deforms infinitely without resistance to change in its shape. 

> **Note:** No body is perfectly elasitc or perfectly plastic. 

## Stress

Unit: $N/m^2$

When a body is deformed by and external deforming force and internal restoring force is developed to bring back the body to its original shape and size.  
The internal restoring force per cross-sectional area of deformation is called stress. 

Since, restoring force = deforming force, 

The formula of stress is given by, 

$$
\frac{Restoring Force}{Area} = \frac{Deforming force}{Area} = \frac{F}{A}  

OR 

\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$

Dimension: $[ML^{-1}T^{-2}]$

## Some Important terms 

1. **Particle**: An object whose mass is finite but size and internal structure can be neglected. In Most cases the motion of large bodies can be described in terms of motion of a particle by considering them to be a rigid body where all particles move with a same velocity, i.e., have only translatory motion. 
2.

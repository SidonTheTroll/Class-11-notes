1. In a parallelogram ABCD, $\overrightarrow{AC}$ and $\overrightarrow{BD}$ are diagonals. Prove that
   1. $\overrightarrow{AC}+\overrightarrow{BD}=2\overrightarrow{BC}$
   2. $\overrightarrow{AC}-\overrightarrow{BD}=2\overrightarrow{AB}$
2. A body simultaneously have 2 velocities, 30 m/s due east and 40 m/s due north. Find resultant velocity (both magnitude and direction).
3. 2 forces $5N$ and $7N$ acts on a particle with an angle $60\degree$ between them. Find resultant force.
4. 2 vectors both of equal magnitude have their resultant equal in magnitude of the either. Find angle between the two vectors. {Answer: $120\degree$}
5. Find the vector AB and its magnitude if its initial points are (1,2,-1) and final points are (3,2,2)

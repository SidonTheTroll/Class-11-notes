1. Show
    1. If a mass $m$ remains ocnstant, the object having more velocity has more momentum. Also draw momentum-velocity graph if mass is constant.
    2. If velocity $v$ is constant, th eobject having more mass have more momentum. Draw momentum-mass graph if velocity is constant. 
    3. Show that if two bodies of different masses have same momentum, velocity of bodies are invesrely proportional to mass. Draw velocity-mass graph if momentum is constant. 
2. A bullet of mass 0.04 kg moving with a speed of 90 m/s enters a heavy wooden log and stops after travelling a distance 60 cm. What is the resistive force exerted by the log on the bullet. 
3. If $\overrightarrow{P}_x =2\ cos\ t$ and $\overrightarrow{P}_y=2\ sin\ t$, find force. Also find the angle between force and momentum. 
4. Define and derive inpulse-momentum theorem. 
5. A ball of mass 50 g falls from a height of 1 m and rebounces to a height of 0.5 m. Find impulse and average forec between the ball and the graound if time and of contact is 0.1 second. 
6. A ball moving with momentum of 5 kg m/s strikes a wall at an angle of $45\degree$ and deflects at the same angle. Calculate change in momentum along x and y axis. 
7. The initial speed of a body of mass 2 kg is 5 m/s. A force acts for 4 seconds in the direction of motion of the body. The force-time graph is shown. Calculate the impulse of the force and find speed of the body.

8. Show that apparent weight of a person inside a lift- 
    1. Increases when lift moves upward.
    2. Decreases when lift moves downwards. 
    3. Is zero if lift is under free fall. 
9. A lift of mass 2000 kg is supported by a thick steel rope. If maximum upward acceleration of the lift is 1.2 $m/s^2$ and breaking stress is $2.8 \times 10^8 N/m^2$, what should be the diameter of the rope? 
10. Derive equation of law of conservation of momentum from Newton's 3rd law. 
11. A 30 kg shell is flying at 48 m/s. When is explodes, its one part of 18 kg stops while the remaining flies on. Find velocity of the later. 
12. A mas of 6 kg is suspended by a rope of length 2 m from a ceiling. A force of 50 N in the horizontal direction is applied on the middle of the rope as shown. What is the angle that the rope makes with the vertical when it is in equilibrium.

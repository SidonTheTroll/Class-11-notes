# Physical Quantities 
Any quantity which can be measured is called a physical quantity. Eg. temperature, pressure, weight, etc. 

- Physical quantity 
  - Base physical quantity 
  - Derived physical quantity 

## Base Physical Quantity
1. Length 
2. Time 
3. Electric Current 
4. Temperature 
5. Amount of substance 
6. Luminous intensity 

## Derived Physical Quantity
1. $\text{Area} = \text{length} * \text{length}$
2. $\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{length} \times \text{length}$
3. $\text{Velocity} = \text{length} \times \text{time}$ 
4. $\text{Acceleration} = \frac{length}{time}\times\text{time}$

# Measurement 
It is the process of determining how large or small a physical quantity of the same kind. 

Measurement is numerical value times unit.

# Units 

## System of Units 
1. MKS
2. CGS 
3. FPS

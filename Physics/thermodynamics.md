# Thermodynamics 

It is the branch of physics that deals with the relation between heat and work. 

# Laws of Thermodynamics

1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: two bodies or systems that are in thermo-equilibrium with a third body are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 
2. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: If some heat is applied to a system that is capable of doing work then heat absorbed by the system will be equal to the sum of the increase in internal energy and the external work done by the system on the surrounding, i.e., heat supplied is partly used to increase the internal energy of the system and the rest in work done on the environment by the system.  
This law is based on Conservation of Energy 
3. **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: Heat flows naturally from a hot body to a cold one. ANd heat will never itself from cold to hot body. 

# Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics 

## Concept of Temperature

This law suggests that when two systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium, then there bust exist a physical quantity that has same value for system in equilibrium. This giving rise to the concept of temperature. 

> Temperature is a scalar quantity and its equality is a necessary and sufficient condition to say if a body is in thermal equilibrium. 

## Internal Energy 

The internal energy of a system is the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energy. 

## Types of Kinetic Energy 

1. Translational Kinetic Energy 
2. Rotational Kinetic Energy 
3. Vibrational Kinetic Energy 

## Sign convertion used for measurement for heat, work and internal energy

# Indicator Diagram 

There are 3 dynamic variable in thermodynamics; pressure, volume and temperature.  
A graphical representation of state of system with the help of any two thermodynamic variables is called an indicator diagram.  
Most commonly used indicator diagram in thermodynamics is P-V diagram. 

#### Note 
Area under P-V diagram gives work done 

$F = P A $  
$dw = F \cdot ds $  
$\implies PA \cdot ds$  
$\therefore Total area = \int dw \int PdV$

# Thermodynamics 

It is the branch of physics that deals with the relation between heat and work. 

# Laws of Thermodynamics

1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: two bodies or systems that are in thermo-equilibrium with a third body are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 
2. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: If some heat is applied to a system that is capable of doing work then heat absorbed by the system will be equal to the sum of the increase in internal energy and the external work done by the system on the surrounding, i.e., heat supplied is partly used to increase the internal energy of the system and the rest in work done on the environment by the system.

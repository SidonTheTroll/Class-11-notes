1. Explain about your favourite game. (Introduction, History and their skills)
> Competitive typing, also known as competitive keyboarding or competitive typing speed, is a popular activity and sport that focuses on measuring and improving one's typing skills, particularly speed and accuracy. It involves timed typing tests and competitions where participants aim to achieve the highest words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM) rates while maintaining a low error rate. Competitive typing allows individuals to develop exceptional typing skills, which are essential in today's digital age for various professions and daily activities, emphasizing mental and physical dexterity valued in fields like data entry, transcription, programming, and content creation.
    The history of competitive typing can be traced back to the early days of typewriters. The first typing speed records were established on typewriters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the advent of personal computers and the widespread use of keyboards, typing speed became even more significant. The popularity of competitive typing soared with the rise of the internet and the increasing demand for fast and accurate typing skills in various professions.
Competitive typing requires the development of several key skills to achieve high typing speeds with accuracy. These skills include:

Touch Typing: The ability to type without looking at the keyboard is crucial in competitive typing. Touch typists use the "home row" technique, where their fingers rest on specific keys (ASDF for the left hand, JKL; for the right hand) and reach for other keys without visual assistance.

Hand Placement and Posture: Proper hand placement and ergonomic posture are essential for speed and efficiency. Maintaining a neutral wrist position, using all fingers for typing, and minimizing unnecessary movements are vital to avoid fatigue and maximize speed.

Finger Dexterity: Developing finger dexterity enables typists to perform swift and precise movements across the keyboard. Practicing finger exercises and drills helps in strengthening and training the muscles to move quickly and accurately.

Muscle Memory: By repeatedly typing common letter combinations, words, and phrases, typists can develop muscle memory. This allows them to type without consciously thinking about the position of each key, increasing their speed and reducing errors.

Focus and Concentration: Concentration is crucial in competitive typing, as distractions can lead to mistakes. Typists must maintain a high level of focus to read the text accurately and translate it into typed words efficiently.

Error Management: Effectively managing errors is essential in competitive typing. Skilled typists quickly recognize and correct mistakes without losing their flow, ensuring minimal impact on their overall speed.

Competitive typing enthusiasts practice rigorously to improve their skills, participating in tests, competitions, and challenges. They measure progress and compare performance with others. Online platforms offer courses, drills, and interactive exercises to enhance speed and accuracy. Competitive typing fosters personal growth, efficiency, and valuable skills in today's digital world, providing career advantages and opportunities for skilled typists.

2. Explain about Physiology, psychology, bio-mechanics and kinesiology in detail. 
> Physiology:
Physiology is the scientific study of how the human body functions. It focuses on the mechanisms and processes that occur within the body to maintain homeostasis and carry out various functions. In the context of sports and exercise, physiological factors such as cardiovascular function, respiratory function, muscular function, and energy systems play a crucial role. Understanding physiological principles helps in optimizing performance, designing training programs, and promoting overall health and well-being.

Psychology:
Psychology involves the study of human behavior, thoughts, emotions, and mental processes. In sports and exercise, psychology explores how psychological factors influence performance, motivation, learning, and the overall well-being of athletes and individuals engaging in physical activity. It encompasses areas such as motivation, goal setting, concentration, stress management, confidence, and psychological skills training. Sports psychologists work with athletes to enhance mental resilience, improve performance under pressure, and promote psychological well-being.

Biomechanics:
Biomechanics is the study of the mechanics of living organisms, particularly the movement and forces applied to the body. It examines how forces and motion affect the body's structure and function during physical activities. In sports and exercise, biomechanics analyzes human movement patterns, techniques, and efficiency to improve performance and prevent injuries. It involves studying variables like joint angles, forces, velocities, accelerations, and impact forces. Biomechanical analysis helps in optimizing movement patterns, equipment design, and injury prevention strategies.

Kinesiology:
Kinesiology is the study of human movement and physical activity from a multidisciplinary perspective. It combines elements of physiology, psychology, biomechanics, and other related fields to understand and improve human performance, health, and well-being. Kinesiology encompasses various sub-disciplines, including exercise physiology, sport psychology, biomechanics, motor learning, and physical education. It provides a holistic approach to studying movement, integrating scientific principles and practical applications to enhance performance, prevent injuries, and promote an active and healthy lifestyle.

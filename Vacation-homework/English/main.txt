3. The story, "We're not afraid to die" has a lesson "optimism helps to endure direst stress." Do you agree? Why/why not? 
> The true story depicted in "We're Not Afraid to Die..." showcases the remarkable qualities of courage, determination, and optimism. The narrator, accompanied by his wife and two children, embarked on a round-the-world voyage aboard the Wavewalker. However, their journey took a perilous turn when they encountered severe weather conditions in the Indian Ocean, causing extensive damage to their boat.

In the midst of the chaos, the narrator was unexpectedly thrown overboard but managed to find his way back onto the boat. Sadly, the children also suffered injuries. As the boat started to flood, the situation seemed dire, yet nobody on board gave up. The narrator persevered in his efforts to salvage the boat, while the children maintained unwavering faith in their father.

Despite their tireless pumping to remove water from the vesssel, it seemed that more water would inevitably find its way inside. Gradually, the storm's fury subsided, but the boat continued to leak. Nevertheless, the narrator skillfully steered the damaged vessel towards Ile Amsterdam, a distance of 165 kilometers. Throughout this harrowing ordeal, all members of the crew, including the children, remained hopeful and optimistic, never succumbing to despair. Their unwavering positivity served as a source of strength and inspiration for the narrator.


4. Write a brief note on the Garoghlanian family as perceived by the narrator. (The Summer Of The Beautiful White Horse)
> The Garoghlanian family, despite their profound poverty, maintained a remarkable reputation for honesty throughout their tribe's history. Despite their destitution, every branch of the family upheld their unwavering integrity. Even the elderly members of the family couldn't comprehend how they managed to provide for their families without any apparent means. Their ancestors had established a legacy of honesty that spanned over eleven centuries, even during times when they were considered among the wealthiest families. The family took immense pride in their ethical principles, firmly believing in distinguishing between right and wrong. They never exploited or stole from others, and it was inconceivable for anyone to accuse a member of the family falsely of being a thief.

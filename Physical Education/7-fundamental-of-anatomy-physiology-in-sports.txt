Anatomy: Human anatomy is the scientific study of the structure and organization of the human body. It involves the examination and description of the various parts, structures, and systems that make up the human being.

Physiology: Human physiology is the scientific study of the functions and mechanisms that occur within the human body. It focuses on how various systems, organs, tissues, and cells work together to maintain the body's overall function and homeostasis

>>> Importance of anatomy and physiology

1. Anatomy provides knowledge of structure of various organs, bones, glands, etc.
    It enables us to understand about the shape, structuse, location, size and weight of all the organs of our body. Such knowledge helps us to select sportsperson based on their traits. 

2. Physiology provides knowledge of functions of different organs. 
    Helps us gain detailed knowledge about the functions of the various organs of the body. It also provides the knowledge of capacities and capabilities of the cardiovascular system, nervous system, muscular system, etc.

3. Helpful in the prevention from sports injuries. 
    It case of any injury in sports such as sprain, fracture, bruises, etc, the knowledge of human anatomy and physiology helps to minimize sports injuries during various sports training and competitions. 

4. Helpful in the process of rehabilitations.
    Proper rehabilitation enables the player to perform well even after getting injured by helping him/her to gradually return to sports and also helping in performance enhancement.

5. Helpful in the selection of sports. 
    Knowledge of anatomy and physiology helps sportsperson to choose a proper sports as per his/her capabilities as different sports require different traits and capabilities to perform well in the field. 

6. Helpful in the preparation of training programs. 
    Physical education teachers and coaches should have proper knowledge of human anatomy and physiology in order to prepare good training programs and having such knowledge also helps to understand the structure and physiological capabilities of an individual or sportsperson. 

7. Aid in sports massage.
    Sports massage helps to change or settle the imbalances in soft tissues which are usually imbalanced by repetive physical activities. By providing sports massage before and after training can reduce injuries and enhance performance. 

8. Facilitate understanding of environmental effects on sportspersons.
    Anatomy and physiology explain how environmental factors affect sportspersons' thermoregulation, cardiovascular function, respiratory system, hydration, musculoskeletal system, and neural adaptation

9. Helpful to know about chemical changes during exercises. 
    The knowledge of human physiology helps to make the required changes in the balnaced diet resulting in the enhancement of the sports performance of the sportsperson.

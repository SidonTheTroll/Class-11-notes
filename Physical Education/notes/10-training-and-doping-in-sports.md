# Training and Doping in Sports 

# Meaning and Concept of Sports Training 

Training is a process in which we prepare ourselves for a task to achieve success under the guidance or supervision of an expert. It is considered an important part of perparing a sportsperson. Preparation is a complex process and directly influences the sportsperson's development and performance. 

# Definition of Sports Training 

According to Martin, "Sports training is a planned and coontrolled process in which, for achieving a goal, changes in complex sports motor performance, ability to act and behavior are made through measures of content, method and organization."

It is a systematic process with the objective of improving the athlete's fitness in a selected activity. It is a long term process that is progressive and recognizes the individual athlete's needs and capabilities. 

# Principles of Sports Training 

### Regularity 

Training should be regular without any long term breaks for consistency. 

### Proper Loading 

The load should be gradually increased after the adaptation of the previous work or load. 

### Scientific and Specific Training 

The activity must be done in according to the requirement of the game. 

### Individual Difference 

The training programmes must be according to the limits of the individual, keeping in mind the age, sex, height, heredity and environmental factors. 

### Recovery 

There should be proper rest after schedule of hard work. But should be not very long. 

### Proper Warming-up and Limbering-down 

This is essential because it reduces the injuries. 

### Progression 

The training programmes should follow a proper progression. It should start easy and become harder later. 

### Safety and Prevention 

Always mind the safety of the athletes as the prevention is much better than solving the issue. 

### Principles of Rest nad Recovery 

The programme should be in such a way that the trainees get proper rest and intervals during activities as the body needs some time to become stronger. 

### Principles of Ensuring Results 

Sports training's main goal: Optimize performance for peak competition and sustain excellence over time.

### Principles of Cyclicity 

Sports training programmmes are developed thorught various training cycles, i.e., duration of training in a period, Macro cycle: having duration of 3–12 months; Meso cycle of 3–6 weeks; and Micro cycle of 5–10 days. 

### Principles of Specificity 

Specific exercise improves certain parts of the body and one should maintain a balance for the requirements of the sports. 

### Principles of Active Involvement 

The principle of active involvement means that the athlete must actively and willingly participate in training programmes regularly. 

### Principles of Variety 

Keep training engaging and effective by incorporating variety. Switch up exercises, alter playing areas, and diversify the training program for sustained athlete interest and long-term progress.

# Training Load: Overload, Adaptation and Recovery 

### Load 

Load is the natural outcome of athletic endeavors, encompassing conditioning, training, and competition. It represents the challenges an individual faces before, during, or after an activity. Managed wisely, it can enhance athletic capacity, performance, and reduce the risk of injury and illness. Load is a dynamic process with internal and external elements, the outcome of which depends on how the individual responds to and handles it.

### Overload 

Overload, stemming from excessive or poorly managed exercise, can lead to physiological and psychosocial issues, impacting performance and increasing the risk of injury and illness. To optimize performance and prevent harm, it's crucial to identify, modify, and minimize overload through effective strategies.

### Recovery 

The recovery process after physical exertion is crucial for athletic performance. Sufficient recovery leads to positive adaptations, enhancing athletic capacity and reducing the risk of injuries and illness. Conversely, insufficient recovery can lead to negative effects, impairing performance and increasing the likelihood of injuries and illness.

### Adaptation 

Adaptation involves the body's adjustment to external load, ultimately enhancing performance. The interplay between the processes of load and recovery occurs simultaneously, contributing to the body's ability to efficiently handle physical demands.

# Concept of Doping and its Disadvantages 

## Concept of Doping 

Doping refers to the use of prohibited substances or methods to enhance athletic performance. These substances and methods are often referred to as performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) or doping agents. Doping is considered unethical and is strictly prohibited in competitive sports due to its potential to provide an unfair advantage and compromise the integrity of the competition. 

Breaking any anti-doping rules is also considered doping. These include the following: 

1. Use or attempt to use a prohibited substance or method. 
2. Presence of a prohibited substance or method. 
3. Failure to file athlete's whereabouts after being notified. 
4. Refusing to submit a sample collection after being notified. 
5. Possession of a prohibited substance or method. 
6. Tampering with any part of the doping control process. 

## Classification of Doping 

Doping can be classified into two types:  
1. Performance enhancing substances 
2. Physical methods 

###  Performance Enhancing Substances 

1. **Peptide Hormones**: peptide hormones are substances that are produced by glands in the body. These substances circulate in the blood. These substances can improve the growth of muscles, change the balance of other hormones and increase the production of red blood cells, which increases the ability of blood to carry oxygen. 

2. **Stimulants**: Stimulants are drugs that boost alertness, physical activity, heart and breathing rates, and brain function. They stimulate the body both physically and mentally, also increasing aggressiveness.

3. **Diuretics**: Diuretics are non-performance enchancing drugs but these are used in sports to remove fluids from the body particlarly water. These can also be taken to reduce the weight loss rapidly as in weight-lifting, boxing, wrestling, etc. These are taken by athletes to in-and-out of competitions. 

4. **Narcotics**: Narcotics like morphine, heroin, and pethidine are sometimes used in sports to alleviate pain or enable sustained effort. However, relying on these drugs during competition can pose risks, potentially leading to further injury.

5. **Cannabinoids**: Cannabinoids are psychoactive chemicals that cause a feeling of relaxation. Examples of Cannabinoids are hashish and marijuana. Their use in competition is banned. 

6. **Glucocorticosteroids**: These drugs relieve pain and fatigue. Theses drugs increase the enhanced tolearnce of pain and prepare the athletes to continue the efforts. 

7. **Beta-2-Agonists**: These drugs are generally used to treat asthama. Only due to that this kind of drug is found in asthama inhalers. These drugs relax the muscles that surround the airway and opening of air passages. Indeed, these drugs allow more oxygen to reach the blood. 

8. **Anabolic Steroids**: Anabolic steroids stimulate the growth of muscles and help athletes to train harder and recover rapidly. By increasing the muscle size and strength, they enhance the performance in sports. 

### Physical Methods 

1. **Blood Doping**: Blood doping, as per WADA, boosts red blood cell count to enhance athletic performance. Autologous involves freezing an athlete's blood, re-infusing it near the competition. Homologous injects fresh blood from another person. Both methods improve oxygen capacity, boosting muscle endurance. Artificial oxygen carriers are another form of blood doping.

2. **Gene Doping**: Gene doping involves manipulating cells or genes to enhance sports performance. By modifying genes, athletes seek to achieve faster reactions and increased physical strength.


## Disadvantages of Doping

3. Increased sex drive
4. Risk of heart failure/heart attacks
5. Impaired liver function

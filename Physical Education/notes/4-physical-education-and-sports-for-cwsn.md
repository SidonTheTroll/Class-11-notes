# Aims and Objectives of Adaptive Physical Education 

## Meaning of Adaptive Physical Education 

**AAHPERD**: Americal Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance. 

Adaptive Physical Education is a sub-discipline of Physical Education. This provides a few programes designed and developed specially for disabled students. 

A program for APE involves physical fitness of the child, motor skills, pattern aquatic skills, individual games and sports for the disabled children. 

Adaptive Physical Education can be defined as "A diversified programme of developmental activities, games, sports and rhythms suited to the interests, capacities and limitations of disabled students who may not safely or successfully engage in unrestricted participation in the general Physical Education Programme". It provides same and sound, personally satisfying and sccessful experiences related to physical activities for disabled children. 

## Aims of Adaptive Physical Education 

The aim of adapted or adaptive physical education is to help of aid disabled students to achieve physical, mental, emotional and social growth, proportionate to their potential, through a special planned programme of regular physical education and recreatinal activities. Its aim is to provide equal opportunities to disabled students for participating in physical education programmes, safely and successfully, in the least restrictive environment. 

## Objectives of Adaptive Physical Education 

### 1. Medical Check-Up 

Success in Adaptive PE hinges on thorough student medical check-ups, determining the type and percentage of disability they face. Complete medical examinations are vital for effective program planning. 

### 2. Consideration of the Interests of the Students 

Tailoring Adaptive PE programs requires a foundation in students' interests, abilities, past experiences, and limitations. Program planners or teachers need profound insights into students' limitations, interests, and aptitudes to create and deliver effective programs.

### 3. Utilization of Special Types of Equipments 

Adaptive Physical Education equipment must align with students' needs, designed for accessibility to cater to disabled students. Tailored to students' levels, the equipment should be colorful, varied in size and weight, and attractive. For visually impaired students, incorporating sound, like bells in balls, aids awareness. Larger balls with attached yarn facilitate striking, catching, and throwing, ensuring an inclusive approach to meet diverse capabilities.

### 4. Improvise Rules and Regulation 

Rules and regulations in Adaptive Physical Education should be straightforward, adaptable to the evolving needs of disabled students. Time modifications should be implemented as necessary, fostering increased interest and participation among disabled students and encouraging a broader engagement in the activities.

### 5. Creation of Special Environment 

The playing area for disabled students should be restricted due to limited movement capabilities, ensuring ample rest between activities. Specifically, for students with autism, designated relaxation areas are essential. Creating a conducive environment involves considering lighting and sound factors, contributing to a supportive setting for these students.

### 6. Enhancement of Self-esteem and Self-image 

Boosting the self-esteem and self-image of disabled students is a key goal in Adaptive Physical Education. Allowing students to engage in activities based on their abilities is crucial. Setting achievable goals, such as throwing a ball 25 times, encourages progress. As students master these goals, realistic and higher targets can be set, fostering improvement in motor skills and, consequently, enhancing their self-esteem and self-image.

### 7. Assured Participation of Students in Physical Education Programmes 

An essential aspect of Adaptive Physical Education is to facilitate active and regular participation of each student at their individual level, striving to integrate them into the mainstream education program whenever feasible.

### 8. Improve Physical Fitness 

Enhancing the physical fitness of disabled students stands as a crucial objective in Adapted Physical Education. Modified and adaptive exercises are incorporated into the programs to specifically target and improve the physical fitness of these students.

### 9. Motivate Students to Protect Themselves 

Another critical objective of Adaptive Physical Education is to motivate disabled students to safeguard themselves in any situation that might be made worse by specific physical activities.

Employ 'people first' language, referring to them as a person with a disability, avoiding terms like 'the disabled.' Use positive language, such as 'she has epilepsy' instead of 'she is epileptic.' Avoid outdated or negative terms like 'cripple' and euphemisms like 'physically challenged'.

3. **Social Etiquette**: Create accessible and comfortable surroundings for people with disabilities. Avoid assumptions about their abilities, offer assistance when needed, respect their independence and decision-making. Never play with their equipment or inquire about their disability unless you know the person. Foster a culture of inclusion in your environment.

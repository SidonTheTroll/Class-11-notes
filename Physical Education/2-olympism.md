# Olympism - Concept and Olympic Values 
The concept of Olympism was introduced more than 120 years ago by Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Modern Olympic Movement. According to him, "Olympism is not a system; it is a state of mind. It can permeate a wide variety of modes of expression and no single race or era can claim to have the monopoly of it." Olympism aims to show that sport can make us all better citizens through the combination of mind, body and spirit. Its goal is to help the development of positive relationships between communities and nations. 

According to it, sport is a universal human right and we all should be free to practice it. The Olympic Committee (IOC) constituted itself on 23rd June 1894 and formalized Olympism in the Olympic Charter. The IOC has identified three Olympic Values: **Excellence, Friendship and Respect.**

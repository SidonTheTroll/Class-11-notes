This would take place on the last day of the Olympics when the winner is announced then the Greek judge places a sacred olive ornament on the winner's head, then a palm branch in his hands while the spectators cheered and threw flowers, red ribbons were tied on his head and hands as a mark of victory. 

## Modern Olympics Games 
Reviving the ancient Olympic games went to French Bason, Pierre de Coubertin who was born in Paris on 1st January, 1963. Refused careers in literature and history and chose to work in sociology and education. Due to his efforts, the first inter-school athletic games were held in Paris in 1889. 

Due to Coubertin's untiring efforts, he succeeded in organizing a Congress on 23rd June 1894, the Olympics was organized again in Greece in 1896. 

Since 1896, the Olympics have been held regularly except in 1916, 1940 and 1944 due to the first and second World Wars.

# Olympism - Concept and Olympic Values 
The concept of Olympism was introduced more than 120 years ago by Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the Modern Olympic Movement. According to him, "Olympism is not a system; it is a state of mind. It can permeate a wide variety of modes of expression and no single race or era can claim to have the monopoly of it." Olympism aims to show that sport can make us all better citizens through the combination of mind, body and spirit. Its goal is to help the development of positive relationships between communities and nations. 

According to it, sport is a universal human right and we all should be free to practice it. The Olympic Committee (IOC) constituted itself on 23rd June 1894 and formalized Olympism in the Olympic Charter. The IOC has identified three Olympic Values: **Excellence, Friendship and Respect.**

## Excellence 
It refers to doing the best we can on the field of play or in our professional life. It is important to not triumph but struggle. 

## Friendship 
Olympism is based on building a peaceful and better world through sport. 

## Respect 
It refers to giving respect to yourself and your body, to other people, to the rules and regulations, to sports and to the environment. 

# Olympics - Symbols, Motto, Flag, Oath and Anthem 

## Olympic Symbol 
It is represented by 5 interlocked rings of different colors (blue, black, red, yellow, green). Designed by Pierre de Coubertin, it represents how athletes from all over the world come together for the Olympic games. 

The five rings symbolize the "five parts of the world" where the Olympic movement was active when the symbol was created. 

## Motto 
Originally, it was "Citius, Altius, Fortius" which means "faster, higher, braver" in Latin. First introduced in the Paris Olympics, 1924, in 2021, the IOC amended an addition making it "Citius, Altius, Fortius - Communis", adding 'together' to the motto. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Also side note that official sources say its "Citius, Altius, Fortius - Communiter". Yeah I know, Indian Books are trash and have a lot of misinformation.

## Flag 
The flag was created by Baron Coubertin in 1913 and was released in 1914. It has a white border without any border with five interlocked rings in the center. The design represents the five continents, united by Olympism. The flag was first hoisted in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium. 

## Oath 
The Olympic oath is a solemn promise made by an athlete, referee or coach, at the Opening Ceremony on behalf of their country. The oath is a commitment to respect the rules and take part in the competitive spirit of fair play. 

## Anthem
This is also known as the Olympic hymn and was composed by the Greek opera Spyridon Samaras and the words were given by the Greek poet Kostis Palamas. First played at the 1896 Olympic Opening Ceremonies. It is played when the Olympic Flag is raised during the opening ceremony and again as the flag is lowered.

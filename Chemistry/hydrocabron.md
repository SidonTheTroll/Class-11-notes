# Conformation of Alkanes 
The relative spatial arrangement that arises because of rotation around the single bond is called conformations rotational isomers or rotamers. 

# Types of Conformations 
1. **Staggered Conformation:** In this conformation, the rotation about $C-C$ bonds is such that the hydrogen atoms attached to the two carbon atoms are a maximum distance apart.
2. **Eclipsed COnformation:** In this case, the rotation about $C-C$ bonds is such that the hydrogen atom attached to one of the carbon atoms completely covers the hydrogen atom attached to the other carbon atom.

# New-man Representation 

# Conformation in Propane 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rotamers aren't possible for unsaturated compounds because they are rigid bonds. 

# Torsional Strain 
It may be defined as the repulsive interaction between electron clouds which effects the stability of a conformation. 

# Torsional Energy
The energy required to overcome torsional strain so that the rotation about the $C-C$ bond may be possible. Eg. torsional energy of eclipsed conformation of ethane is $12.5\ kJ/mol$ more than the staggered conformation, that means when ethane is to be rotated from staggered to eclipsed, $12.5\ kJ/mol$ of energy is required. 

# Wurtz Reaction
When alkyl halide is heated with metallic sodium $(CH_3-I+2Na)$ in the presence of dry ether, alkane is formed. 

## Limitation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Methane cannot be formed.
> 2. Assymemetrical compounds are hard to form purely. It always forms in mixture. Also, their boiling point is almost the same.

In case two different alkyl halides are used as reagents, then a mixture of 3 different alkanes is formed.

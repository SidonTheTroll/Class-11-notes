# Laws 

1. **Aufbau Principle**: In the ground state of an atom, the electrons are **added progressively** to the various orbatals in **increasing order of energies**

$1 \rightarrow K = s$  
$2 \rightarrow L = sp$  
$3 \rightarrow M = spd$  
$4 \rightarrow N = spdf$

2. **Paulie's Exclusion Principle**: According to it, an orbital can have maximum of 2 electrons only and their **spins are opposite**. 

3. **Hund's Rule for Maximum Multiplicity**: When more than one orbitals of equal energies are available, the electrons will first occupy these orbaital singly with parallel spins. The pairing of electrons will then take place. 

| Orbitals | Electrons (max)  |
| :---- | :---- | 
| $s$ | 2 |
| $p$ | 6 |
| $d$ | 10 | 
| $f$ | 14 | 

$\uparrow: \text{Clockwise/up spin}$  
$\downarrow: \text{Anti-clockwise/down spin}$

# Electronic Concept of Oxidation and Reduction

- $\text{Oxd}^n$:
  - Addition of $O$, removal of $H$
  - Loss of $e^-$

$Na \rightarrow Na^+ + 1e^-$$  
$Fe \rightarrow Fe^3+ + e^-$  
$S^{2-} \rightarrow S + 2e^-$$  

- $\text{Red}^n$: 
  - Removal of $O$, addition of $H$
  - Gain of $e^-$

$Cl + e^- \rightarrow Cl^-$
$\underset{Ferricyanoion}{[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}} + e^- \rightarrow \underset{Ferrocyanoion}{[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}}$

# Oxidation Number 

Oxidation numebr is the oxidation state of an element in a compound following a set of rules.

## Rules 

1. Elements with no charge have zero oxidation number.
2. $NH^4$, $SO_3^\text{2-}$, $Cl^-$, $Mg^{+2}$ have +1, -2, -1 , +2 oxidation number respectively. 
3. For **Hydrogen**
    1. H $\rightarrow$ +1 (when with non-metal)
         - Eg: $HCl$
    2. $H$ $\rightarrow$ -1 (when with metal)
      - $NaH$
4. For **Oxygen**
    1. $O$ $\rightarrow$ -1 (for peroxides)
        - $H_2O_2$, $Na_2O_2$
    2. $O$ $\rightarrow$ +2 (for Oxygen dyfloride)
       - $OF_2$
    3. $O$ $\rightarrow$ -1 (for dyoxygen dyfloride)
       - $O_2F_2$ 
5. **Halogens** usually -1, positive with oxygen.
6. If a compound is between metal and non-metal, **metal shows positive oxidation state** and **non-metal shows negative oxidation state**. 
- $\underset{+1}{Na}\underset{-1}{Cl}$ and $\underset{+2}{Mg}\underset{-2}{Cl}$
7. In non-metal + non-metal, 
  - $\underset{{+ve\text{ }oxd^n\text{ }state}}{\text{Non-metal}}$ $+$ $\underset{-ve\text{ }oxd^n\text{ }state}{\text{Non-metal}}$

### Electo negitivity 

It is the ability of an atom (deficient in electron to fulfil its octet) to attract an electron to become in noble gas configuration is called eletronegativity. 

# Balancing Chemical Equation by Oxidation Number Method 

## Redox Reaction in Acidic Medium 

$Ag + NO^-_3 \rightarrow Ag^+ + NO$

### Step 1: Assign Oxidation Numbers 
 
> Determine the oxidation numbers of each element in the equation:  
> 
> **Element by itself**: 0
> **Group 1A**: always +1 
> **Group 2A**: always +2
> **Halogens**: usually -1, positive with Oxygen 
>
> - Monatomic ion: ion charge
>   1. $H$: +1 with non-metals, -1 with metals 
>   2. $O$: Usually -2, -1 in peroxide ($H_2O_2$)
>   3. $F$: always -1 
> 
> Sum of ON's for a neutral compound: 0  
> Sum of ON's for a polyatomic ion = ion charge
>
> Assign oxidation numbers to each element:

$\overset{0}{Ag} + \overset{+5}{N}\overset{-6}{O^-_3} \rightarrow \overset{+1}{Ag^+} + \overset{+2}{N}\overset{-2}{O}$

### Step 2: Figure out what's being oxidized and reduced
>
> Reduction = gain of electron $\rightarrow$ $ON\downarrow$  
> Oxidation = loss of electrons $\rightarrow$ $ON\uparrow$

$\therefore \text{Silver is oxidized}$  
$\And\text{ Nitrogen is reduced}$

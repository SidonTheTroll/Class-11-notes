# Doberiener's Triads 
This is the early attempt at systemizing elements proposed by Johann Wolfgang Doberiener.  
Here, elements are arranged with similar properties (physical and chemical) in groups of three called **Triads**. Where the atomic mass of the middle element was almost the mean or average of the atomic masses of the first and the third elements.

$$
\text{1st Triad:}\ Li, Na, K\\
\text{Atomic Mass:}\ 6.9, 23, 39.0 
$$

- **Common Properties (in the elements above)**
    - All three elements are metal.
    - All of them react with water to form hydroxide (base)
    - All of them are monovalent. 

$$
\text{2nd Triad:}\ Ca, Sr, Ba\\
\text{Atomic Mass:}\ 40.1, 87.6, 137.3 
$$

- **Common Properties (in the above elements)**
    - All are metal
    - All are divalent
    - All of them impart characteristic color to the flame. 

$$
\text{3rd Triad:}\ Cl, Br, I\\
\text{Atomic Mass:}\ 35.5, 79.9, 126.9
$$

- **Characteristics** 
    - All elements are non-metal and diatomic gases
    - All of them are monovalent
    - All of them react with water to form mineral acid

> [!CAUTION] Limitations 
> - All the elements could not be arranged known at that time into Triads. 

# Newland's Law of Octaves 
When elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses, there is a repetition of the property of every 8th element as compared to the given element. 


| | | | | | | |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |:-:| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $H$  | $Li$ | $Be$ | $B$ | $C$ | $N$ | $O$ |

| $Br$ | $Rb$ | $Sr$ | $Ce$ & $La$ | $Zr$ | $-$ | $-$ | 

> [!CAUTION] Limitations
> 1. This classificatin was successful only upto element Calcium. 
> 2. He placed two elements in the same slot and couldn't provide any explaination for such arrangement. 
> 3. He thought 56 elements existed in nature and no more element were likely to be discovered. 
> 4. When noble gases were discovered their inclusion in the table disturbed the entire arrangement. 

# Mandeleev's Periodic Table
The physical and chemical properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic mass. 

> [!NOTE] Description 
> The elements in the periodic table are arranged in vertical columns called groups and horizontal rows called periods. 

There are 9 groups indicated by Roman numerals.  
The elements belonging to the first 7 groups are divided into sub-groups A and B. 

## Limitations of Mandeleev's Periodic Table  

1. **Position of Hydrogen:** Hydrogen had been placed with Alkali metals. 
2. **Anomalous Position:** Although elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic mass. But IN some cases, elements with higher mass precede the elements of lower atomic mass. Eg. argon, potassium, cobalt, nickel. 
3. **Position of Isotopes:** Since the periodic table is arranged in increasing atomic mass, different positions must have been allotted to all isotopes of elements. 
4. **Position of Lanthanoids and Actinoids:** Both these families couldn't find a proper position in the Mendeleev Periodic Table.  

# Modern Periodic Table 
Physical and Chemical properties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic number.

# Structural Feature of Modern Periodic Table 
Modern Periodic table consists of 118 elements arranged in vertical columns called groups and horizontal rows called periods. There are 18 groups and 7 periods. 

## Characteristics of Groups
1. All elements in the group have the same general electronic configuration. 
2. The Atomic size of elements increases down the group. 
3. The physical properties such as melting and boiling point, density, and solubility follow a definite pattern. 
4. The elements belonging to the same group have similar chemical properties as they have the same number of valence electrons. 

## Characteristics of Periods 
1. The atomic size of elements decreases along the period.
2. The electronegative character increases along the period. 
3. All the elements present in the period, the electrons are field in the same valence shell. 
4. The non-metallic character of elements increases along the period. 

## Characteristics of S-Block Elements
1. Elements in group 1 and group 2 have their valence shell $ns^1$ and $ns^2$ respectively. 
2. All the elements are soft metals, they have low melting and boiling points. 
3. The reactivity increases down the group. 
4. They are good reducing agents. 
5. Most of the elements show $+1$ and $+2$ valencies only. Compounds of lithium and beryllium are covalent. 

## Characteristics of P-Block Elements
> [!NOTE]
> **General electronic config:** $ns^2np^{1-6}$ 

1. Compounds of P-Block elements are mostly covalent. 
2. Most of them show variable oxidation states. 
3. The Oxides of most of the elements are acidic. 
4. The reducing character of elements decreases from left to right while oxidizing character agents. 
5. On moving from left to right, the metallic character decreases. 
6. On moving down the group, the metallic character increases. 

## Characteristics of D-Block Elements 
> [!NOTE]
> **General electronic config:** $(n-1)d^{1-10}ns^{1-2}$
1. These elements are known as transition elements because of incompletely filled d-orbital. 
2. Most of them show variable oxidation states. 
3. All the metals have high melting and boiling points. 
4. Most of the elements of D-Block are used as catalyst. 

## F-Block Elements
> [!NOTE]
> **General electronic config:** $(1-2)f^{1-14}(n-1)d^{9-1}ns^2$
1. These elements are also known as inert transition elements. 
2. Atomic numbers 58-71 are called the Lanthanoid series. 
3. Atomic numbers 90-103 are actinoid series. 
4. Most of the elements of the Actinoid series are radioactive.
5. They have high melting and boiling points. 
6. The compounds of these elements are generally colored. 

# Limitations of Modern Periodic Table 
1. The position of Hydrogen is not justified. 
2. Lanthanoids and actinoids are placed separately at the bottom of the periodic table. 

# Physical Properties 
1. **Atomic Radius:** it is the distance from the center of the nucleus to the outermost shell containing the electrons. 
2. **Covalent Radius:** it is the half of the distance between the centers of the nuclei of two adjacent similar atoms joined to each other by a single covalent bond. 
3. **Van der Walle's Radius:** it is the half of the inter-nuclear distance between two similar adjacent atoms belonging to the two neighboring molecules of the same substance. 
4. **Metallic Radius:** half the distance between the center of the nucleus of two adjacent atoms in metallic crystals. 

# Order of Atomic Radius
$\text{Van der Walle's radius} > \text{Metallic Radius} > \text{Covalent Radius}$

# Variation of Atomic Radius 
1. As the number of electrons decreases, the atomic radius decreases. 
2. As we go down the group, atomic size will increase because of the increase in shells. 

# Ionic Radius 
The effective distance from the center of the nucleus of the ion up to which it exerts its influence on the electron cloud. 
- The radius of the cation is always smaller than that of the atom. 
- The radius of the anion is always larger than the atom.

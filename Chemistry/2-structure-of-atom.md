# Thompson's Model of Atom

Thompson's model of an atom can be visualized at a christmas pudding or watermelon with a positively charged shell iwth eletrons embedded in it.

- Number of proton = number of +ve charge

# Rutherford's Model of an Atom

## Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment

<img src="./src/structure-of-atom/gold-foil-experiment.png" width=400 align=right>

### Observations

1. Most of the alpha particles (about 99%) passed through the gold foil undeflected.
2. Some of the particles were deflected by small angles.
3. A very few $\alpha$-particles (1 out of 20k) suffered major deflection (more than $90\degree$) and even came back in the same direction.

### Conclusion

1. As most $\alpha$-particle passed through the atom undeflected thus most of the space inside an atom is empty.
2. As a very few $\alpha$-particle suffered mainr deflection and a very few major deflection, this means that they must have came acros some obstruction which is very small, dense and positively charged.  
   Rutherford regarded this small, heavy and positively charged portion as nucleus. The space surrounding the nucleus as extra-nuclear portion.

### The Model

1. Atom consists of two parts- Nucleus and extra-nuclear portion.
2. Nucleus is present in center of the atom. It is psitively charged and extremely small.
3. The positive charge of nucleus is due to protons.
4. Extra-nuclear is the space around the nucleus in which electons are present.
5. Total -ve charge on the nucleus = total -ve charge on electons as a whole the atom is neutral.
6. Electons in extra-nuclear portion revolve around the nucleus at high speed in circular paths called orbits.

- Neutrons are neutral particle.
- Charge of n = 0
- Mass of n = $1.6 \cdot 10^{-27}kg$

## Drawback

According to Rutherfords's model of atom, the negatively charged electrons revolve around the positively charge nucleus.  
We can say that electron is undergoing acceleration. According to the radiation theory of Maxell when a charged particle is accelerated it emits electro-magnetic radiation. This means that the revolving electron also lose energy continiously in the form of EM radiation. This loss of energy brings the electron closer to the nucleus and ultimately fall into the nucleus following a spiral path. This means that the atom must collapse, Rutherford couldn't counter the Maxwell's theory.

## Atomic Number

(z): number of protons (p)

## Mass number

(A): number of proton + number of neutrons

# Isotopes

Isotopes are the atoms of same element having same atomic number but different mass number.

$H \rightarrow ^1_1H$, $^2_1H(D)$, $^3_1H(T)$

$Cl \rightarrow ^{35}_{17}Cl \text{, } ^{35}_{17}Cl$

$C \rightarrow ^{12}_{6}C, ^{13}_{6}C, ^{14}_{6}C$

# Isobars

- Eg: $^{40}_{18}Ar$, $^{40}_{19}K$, $^{40}_{20}Ca$

# Isotnes

Atoms of different elements which have same number of neutrons.

$^{14}C \rightarrow P:6, n:8$  
$^{15}N \rightarrow P:7, n:8$  
$^{16}O \rightarrow P:8, n:8$-

# Bohr's Atomic Model

<img align=right src='./src/structure-of-atom/bohr-atomic-model.png' width=400>

It was primarily applicable to hydrogen and one electron species like $He^+$ and $Li^{+2}$

1. In hydrogen atom, electrons revolve around the nucleus in a well defined circular path of fixed radius and energy. The circular path is known as orbit and the corresponding energy state is called stationary state.
2. The energy of an electron is its orbit and does not change on its own.
3. When a required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron, it absorbs the same in fixed amounts of bundles called quanta and jumps to higher stationary state clled excited state.
4. Different energy level or energy state for electron are given as K, L, M, N or 1, 2, 3, 4.
5. Only those energy orbits are permitted for the electon in which the angular momentum of the electon is a whole number multiple of of $\frac{h}{2\pi}$, i.e., "$n \cdot \frac{h}{2 \pi}$"
   - Angular momentum of electron = $\omega = mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi}$

- **Planck's constant** = $6.626 \cdot 10^{-34} Joule/second$

6. Energy of stationary state is given by
   - $E_n = R_H(\frac{1}{n^2})$
     - $R_H = \text{Rydberg's constant}$
     - $R_H = 2.18 \cdot 10^{-18} J$

## Mathematically

$\Delta E = E_2 \text{(Higher energy level)}- E_1 \text{Lower energy level}$

## Drawbacks

1. The theory couldn't explain the atomic spectra of the atoms containing more than one atom. 
2. Bohr theory predicted only one spectral line for electronic transistion between two energy levels. However if examined carefully, certain single lines found to contain a number of fine lines. 
3. The splitting of lines in the magnetic field is known as Zeeman effect and the eletric field is called Stark effect. When the source emitting this radiation is subjected to magnetic or eletric field, each spectral line is found to split in number of lines.
4. It cannot explain the shape of molecule. 
5. The theory also failed to explain new principles such as de-Broglie relationship and Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle. 


# Achievements of Bohr's Atomic Model 

1. It has explained the stability of an atom. 
2. It has been used to derive Balmer's formula. 

$E_f = R_H [\frac{1}{{n_f}^2}]$  
and $\Delta E = E_f - E_i$  
$\implies \Delta E = [\frac{-R_H}{{n_f}^2}] + \frac{R_H}{{n_i}^2}$
$\implies \Delta E = \frac{R_H}{{n_i}^2} - \frac{R_H}{{n_f}^2}$

$\therefore \Delta E = R_H (\frac{1}{{n_i}^2}) - \frac{1}{{n_f}^2}$

- If the electron moves from outer to inner shell, it releases energy in the form of EM (electro-magnetic) waves. 

$\Delta E = (2.18 \cdot 10^{-18} J) \cdot (\frac{1}{{n_i}^2} - \frac{1}{{n_f}^2})J$ 

The frequency for the absorbtion and emission of energy can be calculated as follows: 

$\Delta E = h\zeta$  
$\zeta = \frac{\Delta E}{h}$  
$\implies \frac{2.18 \cdot 10^{-8}}{6.626 \cdot 10^{-34}}(\frac{1}{{n_i}^2}- \frac{1}{{n_f}^2})$  
$\zeta = 3.29 \cdot 10^{15}(\frac{1}{{n_i}^2}- \frac{1}{{n_f}^2})$ Hz or $s^{-1}$

$\overline{\zeta} = \frac{\zeta}{\text{Speed of Light}}$  
$\implies \frac{3.29}{3 \cdot 10^8} \cdot 10^{15}(\frac{1}{{n_i}^2}- \frac{1}{{n_f}^2})$  
$\overline{\zeta} = 1.09677 \cdot 10^7 (\frac{1}{{n_i}^2}- \frac{1}{{n_f}^2}) m^{-1}$

# Energy of electron in Hydrogen Atom 

Energy of $n^{th}$ orbit is given by

$E_n = \frac{-2\pi^2k^2m_ee^4z^2}{n^2h^2}$

- K = Permitivity of the medium/material 
- $M_e$ = mass of $e^-$
- e = charge of $e^-$
- z = nuclear charge 
- n = number of $e^-$ orbit 
- h = Planck's constant 

## Example 

$E_n = \frac{-1312}{n^2}KJmol^{-1}$ 

For n = 1, 

$E_1 = -1312 \text{ } KJmol^{-1}$  
$E_2 = -328 \text{ } KJmol^{-2}$  
$E_3 = -145.8 \text{ } KJmol^{-3}$  
$E_4 = -82.0 \text{ } KJmol^{-4}$  
$E_1 = -52.5 \text{ } KJmol^{-5}$

# Dual Behavoir of Matter (de-Broglie equation)

- There are 2 natures of matetr 
    - Particle 
    - Wave 

<br> 

- A moving particle (microscopic as well as macroscopic) has dual nature, i.e., wave and particle nature. 

## de-Broglie equation 

$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$

- $\lambda$ = wavelength 
- p = momentum of the particle 
- h = Planck's constant 
- h = $6.626 \cdot 10^{-34}kgm^2s^{-1}$

Also, 

$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$

Wave nature $\propto$ $\frac{1}{\text{Particle nature}}$

# Relationship between de-broglie equation and Kinetic Energy 

KE = $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$  
E = $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$

Multiplying 2m on both sides, 

$2mE = 2m \cdot \frac{1}{2}v^2$  
$\implies 2mE = m^2v^2$  
$\sqrt{2mE} = P$  
$\lambda = \frac{h}{P}$  
$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE}}$

# Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle

It is not possible to measure simultaneously the position and the momentum of a microscopic particle with absolute accuracy or certainity.   
Alternatively, the product of uncertainity in position and uncertainity in momentum of a microscopic particle is always constant and greater than or equal to $\frac{h}{4\pi}$

Mathematically,

$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$

# Significance of Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle 

According to principle of optics, the accuracy with which a particle can be located depends upon the wavelength of the light used. The uncertainity in position is $\pm \lambda$

$\uparrow E = \frac{hc}{\lambda\downarrow}$  
More the energy, lower the wavelength

$\therefore$ We cannot see a microscopic particle like electron without disturbing it.

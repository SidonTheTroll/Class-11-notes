# 1. Introduction

**Matter**: anything which has mass and occupies space

- Matter
  - Pure: all constituent particles are of same nature
  - Mixture: material made up of two or more different chemical substances which are not chemically bonded.

<br>

- Mixture:
  - Homogeneous: composition is uniform throughout
  - Heterogeneous: components are distinct

<br>

- Chemistry:
  - Organic
  - Inorganic
  - Physical

<br>

- States of matter:
  - Solid: definite shape and volume
  - Liquid: no shape but definite volume
  - Gas: no shape no volume

<br>
Solid $\overset{Melting}{--->}$ Liquid $\overset{Evoporation}{---->}$ Gas

Gas $\overset{Condensation}{--->}$ Liquid $\overset{Solidification}{---->}$ Solid

Solid $\overset{Sublimation}{---->}$ Gas $\overset{Deposition}{---->}$ Solid

| Compound                                                | Mixture                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Composition of eletments are fixed.                  | 1. Composition of elements are not fixed.            |
| 2. Properties of compounds are different from elements. | 2. Shows all properties of its constituent elements. |
| 3. Constituents are separated by chemical methods.      | 3. Constituents are separated by physical methods.   |
| 4. Always homogeneous in nature.                        | 4. Either homogeneous or heterogeneous.              |

### 1.0.1. Physical Properties

- Which can be measured without changing the chemical composition of the substance is known as physical property. Eg- mass, volume, density.

### 1.0.2. Chemical Properties

- Property which require a chemical change to occur is known as chemical property. Eg- acidity, basicity, combustibility.

## 1.1. Seven Fundamental SI units of Measurement

| Physical Quantity   | Name of unit | Abbreviation |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Mass                | kilogram     | kg           |
| Length              | meter        | m            |
| Temperature         | kelvin       | K            |
| Amount of substance | mole         | mol          |
| Time                | second       | s            |
| Electric current    | ampere       | A            |
| Luminous intensity  | candela      | cd           |

## 1.2. Scientific notation

- Proper representation of number in exponential form.  
  i.e.:  
  $N * 10^n$  
  $\text{Where N = non-zero number to the left of decimal and n = any integer}$

<br>

- Power placement
  - L P R N
  - Left-positive, Right negative

<br>

## 1.3. Significant figures

- All certain digits in a measurement plus on e doubtfun digit called '**significant figure**'

1. All non-zero digits are significant.
   - 394 -> 3 S.F.
2. Zeroes between the non-zero are significant.
   - 7002 -> 4 S.F.
3. Preceding zero or zeroes to the left of non-zero is non significant.
   - 0.0045 -> 2 S.F.
4. Zeroes in exponential form are non significant.
   - $4 * 10^2$ -> 1 S.F.
5. Zero at the end or right of a number are significant when decimal is persent.
   - 0.200 -> 3 S.F.
6. Terminal zeroes are non significant if there is no decimal point.
   - 126000 -> 3 S.F.
7. Exact number has infinite significant figure
   - 2 books -> $\infin$ S.F.

### 1.3.1. Calculation of Significant figure

- All result numbers should have the least number of significant figures as given in the quesiton

## 1.4. Precision and Accuracy

**Precision**: Refers to the closeness of various measurements for the same quantity.

**Accuracy**: It is the agreement of particular value to the true value of result when the values of different measurements are close to the true or accurate value

## 1.5. Prefixes used in Numericals

| Prefix   | Symbol                  | Multiple   |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| deci     | d                       | $10^{-1}$  |
| centi    | c                       | $10^{-2}$  |
| milli    | m                       | $10^{-3}$  |
| micro    | $\mu$                   | $10^{-6}$  |
| Pico     | p                       | $10^{-12}$ |
| Deca     | da                      | $10$       |
| Hecto    | h                       | $10^{-12}$ |
| Kilo     | k                       | $10^{-3}$  |
| Mega     | M                       | $10^{-6}$  |
| Amgstorm | $\overset{o}{\text{A}}$ | $10^{-10}$ |


# 2. Laws of Chemical Combination 

## 2.1. Law of Conservation of Mass 

By **Antonie Lavoiser**

- Matter can neither be created nor be destroyed. In other words, total mass of the reactant equal to the total mass of product. 

## Law of Definite Proportion

By **Joseph Proust**

- A given compound always contains exactly the same proportion of element by mass and does not depend on source. 

## Law of Multiple Proportion

- When two element can combine to form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combine other element bear a simple ratio to one another. 

## Law of Combining Volumes

By **Gay Lussac**

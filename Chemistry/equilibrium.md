# Equilibrium 
An equilibrium represents a state in a process when the observable properties such as color, temperature, concentration, etc. don't show any change. 

## Solid-Liquid Equilibrium 
- Ice will only melt or freeze at 1 atm and 720 mm $\text{Hg}$

**At $0\degree C$,**  
$\text{Ice}_{(S)} \leftrightarrows \text{Water}_{(L)}$  
Both exist in the same place simultaneously. 

## Liquid-Gas Equilibrium 
At $100\degree C$, both liquid and gas exist. 

## Solid-Gas Equilibrium 
Exists in some substances that can undergo sublimation. 

# Chemical Equilibrium 
> [!NOTE]
> 1. All reactions here are reversible. 
> 2. Non-reversible reactions' equilibrium can't be studied. 

$A + B \rightarrow C + D$

# Characteristics of Chemical Equilibrium 
1. The observable sequence properties of the system becomes constant once the equilibrium is reached. 
2. The equilibrium is obtained only in the reactions carried in a closed vessel (isolated system). 
3. The equilibrium is dynamic in nature. If $A+B$ took $\Psi$ second to form $C+D$, $C+D$ will also take $\Psi$ second to form $A+B$  
Eg.- Haber's Process  
$N_2 + H_2 \leftrightarrows NH_3$ 
4. A catalyst cannot alter the point of equilibrium, i.e., time is reduced to reach equilibrium but concentration will not change. 

# Laws of Mass Action 
At constant temperature, the rate of chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of molar concentration of the reactants each raised to a power equal to its corresponding stoichiometric value. 

$N_2 + 3H_2 \leftrightarrows 2NH_3$  
Here, 3 and 2 before element symbol are the stoichiometric coefficients. 

For any chemical reaction,  
$aA + bB \rightarrow Product$

$$
\text{Rate of reaction} \propto [A]^a [B^b]    
\implies r = 
$$

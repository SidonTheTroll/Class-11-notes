# Equilibrium 
An equilibrium represents a state in a process when the observable properties such as color, temperature, concentration, etc. don't show any change. 

## Solid-Liquid Equilibrium 
- Ice will only melt or freeze at 1 atm and 720 mm $\text{Hg}$

**At $0\degree C$,**  
$\text{Ice}_{(S)} \leftrightarrows \text{Water}_{(L)}$  
Both exist in the same place simultaneously. 

## Liquid-Gas Equilibrium 
At $100\degree C$, both liquid and gas exist. 

## Solid-Gas Equilibrium 
Exists in some substances that can undergo sublimation. 

# Chemical Equilibrium 
> [!NOTE]
> 1. All reactions here are reversible. 
> 2. Non-reversible reactions' equilibrium can't be studied. 

$A + B \rightarrow C + D$

# Characteristics of Chemical Equilibrium 
1. The observable sequence properties of the system becomes constant once the equilibrium is reached. 
2. The equilibrium is obtained only in the reactions carried in a closed vessel (isolated system). 
3. The equilibrium is dynamic in nature. If $A+B$ took $\Psi$ second to form $C+D$, $C+D$ will also take $\Psi$ second to form $A+B$  
Eg.- Haber's Process  
$N_2 + H_2 \leftrightarrows NH_3$ 
4. A catalyst cannot alter the point of equilibrium, i.e., time is reduced to reach equilibrium but concentration will not change. 

# Laws of Mass Action 
At constant temperature, the rate of chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of molar concentration of the reactants each raised to a power equal to its corresponding stoichiometric value. 

$N_2 + 3H_2 \leftrightarrows 2NH_3$  
Here, 3 and 2 before the element symbol are the stoichiometric coefficients. 

For any chemical reaction,  
$aA + bB \rightarrow Product$

$$
\text{Rate of reaction} \propto [A]^a [B^b] \\ 
\implies r = [A]^a [B^b] \\
[k = \text{rate constant}]
$$

# Law of Chemical Equilibrium 
For a reaction, $aA +bB \ \overset{R_f}{\underset{R_b} {\leftrightarrows}} \ cC + dD$

$k_C$ = equilibrium constant when molar concentration is considered.  
$k_P$ = equilibrium constant when partial pressure is considered. 

$$
k_P = \frac{pC^c\cdot pD^d}{pA^a\cdot pB^b}
$$

## Relation between $k_P$ and $k_C$
$aA +bB \ {\leftrightarrows} \ cC + dD$

$k_C = \frac{[C]^c\cdot [D]^d}{[A]^a\cdot [B]^b}$  
$k_P = \frac{pC^c\cdot pD^d}{pA^a\cdot pB^b}$

**According to Ideal Gas Law,**  
$PV = nRT$  
$\frac{n}{v}=\frac{P}{RT}$  
$C = \frac{P}{RT}$

$P$ = Pressure  
$v$ = volume  
$n$ = number of moles  
$R$ = 0.082 L atm/K/mol

# Characteristics of Equilibrium Constant 
1. The Equilibrium Constant is applicable only when the reactant and product have attained equilibrium. 
2. The value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction is constant at a given temperature. 

### Relation between 2 Equilibrium Constant at Two Different Temperature. 
$\log k_2 - \log k_1 = \frac{\Delta H}{2.303}(\frac{1}{T_1}-\frac{1}{T_2})$

3. The value of the equilibrium constant, $k_c$ doesn't depend on the initial molar concentration of reactants and products. It depends upon the molar concentration in the equilibrium state.
4. The rate of forward reaction is the reciprocal of the rate of backward reaction. 
$$
k_f = \frac{1}{k_b}
$$

# Reaction Constant (Q)
The ratio of the molar concentration of the partial pressure of the product species to that of reacting species at any stage in the reaction.

$aA + bB \leftrightarrows cC + dD$

$$
k_c  = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}\\
Q = \frac{[C]^c[D^d]}{[A]^a[B]^b} , \text{ at time 't'.}
$$

- If $Q=K$, 
    - It means that the reaction is in a state of equilibrium.
- If $Q<K$,
    - The forward reaction of the reactants is going on. 
- If $Q>K$,
  - A backward reaction is going on in the reaction. 

# Relation between Equilibrium Constant (k), Reaction Quotient (Q) and Gibbs' Free Energy (G)

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^0 + RT\ ln\ Q 
$$

Under Equilibrium constant $Q = K$ and $\Delta G =0$

$\Delta G^\Theta = -2.303 RT \log K$

Also, by Gibbs Helmholtz equation, 

$\Delta G^\Theta = \Delta H^\Theta-T\Delta S^\Theta$  
$\Delta H - T\Delta S = -2.303 RT \log K$  
$\Delta H =-2.303 RT \log K + T\Delta S$

# Le-Chatelier's Principle
If a system under equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure or concentration, then the equilibria shift itself in such a way as to undo or neutralize the effect of the change. 

**Eg.-**  
$N^2 + H^2 \leftrightarrows NH_3$ (Exothermic)  
If heat is increased, to nullify the effect of surrounding, backward reaction will occur; and vice versa if heat is decreased. 

$\underset{\text{Yellow}}{FeCl_3} + \underset{\text{Colorless}}{KSCN} \leftrightarrows \underset{\text{Ferric Thyocyanide (Red)}}{[Fe(SCN)]^{2+}}$  
The given solution will be orange in color. 

If $KSCN$ is added to the solution, the color will become more red to neutralize the balance.

$\underset{1\ mol}{N_2O_4} \leftrightarrows \underset{2\ mol}{2NO_2}$

If the vessel is pressurized, $NO_2$ takes more space to exist, therefore the reaction will go backward; vice versa if the pressure is decreased. 

# Ionic Equilibrium 
- **Electrolyte:** It is a solution that contains ions and conducts electricity. Contains cations and anions. Therefore made from salts. 
  - It is formed when salt is dissolved in $H_2O$.
- It has 2 types:
    1. Strong 
    2. Weak
- Strength can be determined by the dissociation of ions and $pH$ ions.

> [!NOTE] 
> Strong electrolites can comletely (100%) dissociate.

# Dissociation of Ionization/Dissociation $(\alpha)$
It is the ratio of molecules of the electrolyte that splits into ions to the total number of molecules of the electrolyte. 

It is given by $(\alpha)$.

Eg.- $\underset{10\ mol}{NaCl}\leftrightarrows \underset{10\ mol}{Na^+} + \underset{10\ mol}{Cl^-}$  
$\alpha = \frac{10}{10}=1$

Eg.- $\underset{10\ mol}{CH_3COONa} \overset{H_2O}{\leftrightarrows} \underset{6\ mol}{CH_3COO^-} + \underset{6\ mol}{Na^+}$  
$\alpha = \frac{6}{10} =\ <1$

- Alpha $(\alpha)$ is always less than 1 for weak electrolites.

# 1. Equilibrium 
An equilibrium represents a state in a process when the observable properties such as color, temperature, concentration, etc. don't show any change. 

## 1.1. Solid-Liquid Equilibrium 
- Ice will only melt or freeze at 1 atm and 720 mm $\text{Hg}$

**At $0\degree C$,**  
$\text{Ice}_{(S)} \leftrightarrows \text{Water}_{(L)}$  
Both exist in the same place simultaneously. 

## 1.2. Liquid-Gas Equilibrium 
At $100\degree C$, both liquid and gas exist. 

## 1.3. Solid-Gas Equilibrium 
Exists in some substances that can undergo sublimation. 

# 2. Chemical Equilibrium 
> [!NOTE]
> 1. All reactions here are reversible. 
> 2. Non-reversible reactions' equilibrium can't be studied. 

$A + B \rightarrow C + D$

# 3. Characteristics of Chemical Equilibrium 
1. The observable sequence properties of the system becomes constant once the equilibrium is reached. 
2. The equilibrium is obtained only in the reactions carried in a closed vessel (isolated system). 
3. The equilibrium is dynamic in nature. If $A+B$ took $\Psi$ second to form $C+D$, $C+D$ will also take $\Psi$ second to form $A+B$  
Eg.- Haber's Process  
$N_2 + H_2 \leftrightarrows NH_3$ 
4. A catalyst cannot alter the point of equilibrium, i.e., time is reduced to reach equilibrium but concentration will not change. 

# 4. Laws of Mass Action 
At constant temperature, the rate of chemical reaction is directly proportional to the product of molar concentration of the reactants each raised to a power equal to its corresponding stoichiometric value. 

$N_2 + 3H_2 \leftrightarrows 2NH_3$  
Here, 3 and 2 before the element symbol are the stoichiometric coefficients. 

For any chemical reaction,  
$aA + bB \rightarrow Product$

$$
\text{Rate of reaction} \propto [A]^a [B^b] \\ 
\implies r = [A]^a [B^b] \\
[k = \text{rate constant}]
$$

# 5. Law of Chemical Equilibrium 
For a reaction, $aA +bB \ \overset{R_f}{\underset{R_b} {\leftrightarrows}} \ cC + dD$

$k_C$ = equilibrium constant when molar concentration is considered.  
$k_P$ = equilibrium constant when partial pressure is considered. 

$$
k_P = \frac{pC^c\cdot pD^d}{pA^a\cdot pB^b}
$$

## 5.1. Relation between $k_P$ and $k_C$
$aA +bB \ {\leftrightarrows} \ cC + dD$

$k_C = \frac{[C]^c\cdot [D]^d}{[A]^a\cdot [B]^b}$  
$k_P = \frac{pC^c\cdot pD^d}{pA^a\cdot pB^b}$

**According to Ideal Gas Law,**  
$PV = nRT$  
$\frac{n}{v}=\frac{P}{RT}$  
$C = \frac{P}{RT}$

$P$ = Pressure  
$v$ = volume  
$n$ = number of moles  
$R$ = 0.082 L atm/K/mol

# 6. Characteristics of Equilibrium Constant 
1. The Equilibrium Constant is applicable only when the reactant and product have attained equilibrium. 
2. The value of the equilibrium constant for a reaction is constant at a given temperature. 

### 6.0.1. Relation between 2 Equilibrium Constant at Two Different Temperature. 
$\log k_2 - \log k_1 = \frac{\Delta H}{2.303}(\frac{1}{T_1}-\frac{1}{T_2})$

3. The value of the equilibrium constant, $k_c$ doesn't depend on the initial molar concentration of reactants and products. It depends upon the molar concentration in the equilibrium state.
4. The rate of forward reaction is the reciprocal of the rate of backward reaction. 
$$
k_f = \frac{1}{k_b}
$$

# 7. Reaction Constant (Q)
The ratio of the molar concentration of the partial pressure of the product species to that of reacting species at any stage in the reaction.

$aA + bB \leftrightarrows cC + dD$

$$
k_c  = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}\\
Q = \frac{[C]^c[D^d]}{[A]^a[B]^b} , \text{ at time 't'.}
$$

- If $Q=K$, 
    - It means that the reaction is in a state of equilibrium.
- If $Q<K$,
    - The forward reaction of the reactants is going on. 
- If $Q>K$,
  - A backward reaction is going on in the reaction. 

# 8. Relation between Equilibrium Constant (k), Reaction Quotient (Q) and Gibbs' Free Energy (G)

$$
\Delta G = \Delta G^0 + RT\ ln\ Q 
$$

Under Equilibrium constant $Q = K$ and $\Delta G =0$

$\Delta G^\Theta = -2.303 RT \log K$

Also, by Gibbs Helmholtz equation, 

$\Delta G^\Theta = \Delta H^\Theta-T\Delta S^\Theta$  
$\Delta H - T\Delta S = -2.303 RT \log K$  
$\Delta H =-2.303 RT \log K + T\Delta S$

# 9. Le-Chatelier's Principle
If a system under equilibrium is subjected to a change in temperature, pressure or concentration, then the equilibria shift itself in such a way as to undo or neutralize the effect of the change. 

**Eg.-**  
$N^2 + H^2 \leftrightarrows NH_3$ (Exothermic)  
If heat is increased, to nullify the effect of surrounding, backward reaction will occur; and vice versa if heat is decreased. 

$\underset{\text{Yellow}}{FeCl_3} + \underset{\text{Colorless}}{KSCN} \leftrightarrows \underset{\text{Ferric Thyocyanide (Red)}}{[Fe(SCN)]^{2+}}$  
The given solution will be orange in color. 

If $KSCN$ is added to the solution, the color will become more red to neutralize the balance.

$\underset{1\ mol}{N_2O_4} \leftrightarrows \underset{2\ mol}{2NO_2}$

If the vessel is pressurized, $NO_2$ takes more space to exist, therefore the reaction will go backward; vice versa if the pressure is decreased. 

# 10. Ionic Equilibrium 
- **Electrolyte:** It is a solution that contains ions and conducts electricity. Contains cations and anions. Therefore made from salts. 
  - It is formed when salt is dissolved in $H_2O$.
- It has 2 types:
    1. Strong 
    2. Weak
- Strength can be determined by the dissociation of ions and $pH$ ions.

> [!NOTE] 
> Strong electrolites can comletely (100%) dissociate.

# 11. Dissociation of Ionization/Dissociation $(\alpha)$
It is the ratio of molecules of the electrolyte that splits into ions to the total number of molecules of the electrolyte. 

It is given by $(\alpha)$.

Eg.- $\underset{10\ mol}{NaCl}\leftrightarrows \underset{10\ mol}{Na^+} + \underset{10\ mol}{Cl^-}$  
$\alpha = \frac{10}{10}=1$

Eg.- $\underset{10\ mol}{CH_3COONa} \overset{H_2O}{\leftrightarrows} \underset{6\ mol}{CH_3COO^-} + \underset{6\ mol}{Na^+}$  
$\alpha = \frac{6}{10} =\ <1$

- Alpha $(\alpha)$ is always less than 1 for weak electrolytes. 

# 12. Theories of Acids and Bases 
## 12.1. Arrhenius Concept of Acid and Base
This concept states that acids are substances that release $H^+$ ions when dissolved in a solvent (water), and bases are substances that release $OH^-$ ions when dissolved. 

- Eg.- 
    - $HCl \rightarrow H^+ + Cl^-$
    - $H_2SO_4 \rightarrow 2H^+ + SO_4^{2-}$
    - $CH_3COOH \leftrightarrows CH_3COO^- +H^+$
    - $H_3PO_4\leftrightarrows 3H^+ + PO_4^{3-}$
    - $NaOH \rightarrow Na^+ + OH^-$
    - $KOH \rightarrow K^+ + OH^-$
    - $NH_4OH \leftrightarrows NH^+_4 + OH^-$

## 12.2. Limitation of Arrhenius Acid and Base
1. **Nature of Hydrogen Ion**: According to the Arrhenius concept acid gives $H^+$ ion but independent existence is not known yet. In reactions, it only exists as a hydronium ion which is relatively stable in comparison to $H^+$

2. It fails to explain the acidic and basic behavior of substances in solvents other than water such as liquid $NH_3$, alcohol, etc. It is only limited to aqueous medium. 

3. It fails to explain the acidic character of substances like $CO_2$, $SO_2$, $SO_3$, etc. which don't have hydrogen ions in them. Also the basic characters of certain substances like $NH_3$, $CaO$, $MgO$, etc. which don't have $OH^-$ ion. 

# 13. Bronsetd Concept of Acid and Base
An acid is a substance that tends to donate proton and a base is a substance that accepts proton. 

$$HCl \overset{H_2O}{\rightarrow} H^+ + Cl^-$$

# 14. Acid-Base Conjugate Pairs 

## 14.1. Conjugate Acid and Base Pairs 

The species which can show both acidic and baseic characteristics are called amphoteric species $(H_2O)$

## 14.2. Relative Strength of Acids and Bases 
1. A strong acid has a weak conjugate base. 
    - Weak = stable 
    - Cation is the reason for resonance which gives stability.
2. A weak acid has a strong conjugate base. 
    - Because of resonance
    - Instability leads to a reverse reaction. 
3. A base in contact with a strong acid acts as a strong base. While a base in contact with a weak acid acts as a weak base. 

## 14.3. Limitations 
1. It fails to explain the acidic character of substances like anhydrous $AlCl_3$, $BF_3$ and $BCl_3$.
2. It doesn't explain the reaction between acidic oxides and basic oxides and 
$CaO + SO_4 \rightarrow CaSO_4$

# 15. Lewis's Concept of Acid and Base 
Acid is a substance that accepts a pair of electrons while base is a substance that can donate a pair of electrons. 

## 15.1. Types of Lewis Base 
1. Neutral molecules having at least 1 lone pair, e.g., $\ddot{N}H_3, R-\ddot{N}H_2, R-\underset{\cdot\cdot}{\overset{\cdot\cdot}{O}}H$
2. Negatively charged ions, i.e., $OH^-, Cl^-,$ etc.

## 15.2. Types of Lewis Acid
1. Molecules in which the central atom has an incomplete octet, e.g., $AlCl_3, BF_3, FeCl_3,$ etc.
2. Cations (all) can behave as Lewis Acid, e.g., $H^+, NH_4^+, Na^+,$ etc.
   1. Smaller cations are more strong Lewis Acid 
3. Molecules having atoms of different electronegativities linked with multiple bonds, e.g., $CO_2, SO_2,$ etc.

# 16. Ionization Product of Water 
$H_2O(l) + H_2O(l) \leftrightarrows H_3O^+ + OH^-$  
$K=\frac{[H_3O^+][OH^-]}{[H_2O]^2}$  
$K[H_2O^2] = [H_3O^+][OH^-]$

$K$ for $H_2O$ is $1\times 10^{-14}\ mol/L$  
$\therefore \text{Water is neutral}$
$$
[H_3O^+]=[OH^-]\\
\implies 1 \times 10^{-14} = [H_3O^+]^2\\
\implies 1 \times (10^{-14})^{\frac{1}{2}} = [H_3O^+]\\
\implies 10^{-7} = [H_3O^+]
$$

<br>

$$
K[H_2O] = [H_3O+][OH^-]\\
\frac{K}{[OH^-]} = [H_3O^+]\\
\frac{10^{-14}}{[>10^{-7}]} = [H_3O^+]\\
<10^{-7} = [H_3O^+]
$$

For a neutral solution, the concentration of $[H^+]$ ions will be $10^{-7}$. For basic, it will be more than $10^{-7}$ and more for acid.

# 17. pH
It is,  
$pH = -\log [H_3O^+]$  
Negative logarithm of $[H_3O^+]$ ion.  
**Similarly**,  
$pOH = -\log[OH]$  
$[H_3O^+][OH^-] = 10^{-14}$

Taking logs on both sides, 

# 18. Salt Hydrolysis 

$$
\text{Salt} + H_2O \rightarrow \text{Acid}+\text{Base}\\
\therefore \underset{\text{(Salt)}}{BA} + H_2O \leftrightarrows HA + BOH
$$

$$
k_h = \frac{[HA][BOH]}{[BA][H_2O]}\\
k_h = \text{Hydrolysis constant}\\
\uparrow k_h = \text{more dissociation}\\
\downarrow k_h = \text{less dissociation}
$$

# 19. Buffer Solution 
A solution that resists a change in $pH$ value on the addition of small amounts of acid or base in it. 

> [!NOTE]
> Most importantly, buffer solution is used in pertoleum industries.

# 20. Types of Buffer Solutions
1. **Simple Buffer:** These are the salts of weak acid and weak base. Eg. ammonium carbonate, ammonium acetate. 
2. **Mixed Buffer:** These are either acidic or basic. 
3. **Acidic Buffer:** They contain equimolar quantities of a weak acid and its salt with a strong base. Eg. boric acid and sodium borax, formic acid and sodium formate. 
$CH_3COOH + CH_3COONa \rightarrow \text{Acidic Buffer}\ (3,5)$
4. **Basic Buffer:** These contain equimolar quantities of a weak base and its salt with a strong acid. 

# 21. Mechanism of Buffer 
$$
\underset{\text{(Weak acid)}}{CH_3COOH} \leftrightarrows CH_3COO^- + H^+\\
CH_3COONa \rightarrow CH_3COO^- + Na^+ \\
HCl\rightarrow H^+ 
$$

According to Le-Chatelier's Principle, the reverse reaction will take place, 
$$
CH_3COOH \leftrightarrows CH_3COO^- + H^+\\
$$  
Therefore, nullifying the reaction. 

If a base is taken, eg. $NaOH$,  
$OH^-$ reacts with $H^+$ forming $H_2O$  
Forward reaction will take place.   
$CH_3COOH \leftrightarrows CH_3COO^- + H^+$  
Neutralizing the reaction. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Basic buffer works in the same way.** 

# 22. Common Ion Effect 

The suppression in dissociation of weak electrolytes by the addition of a strong electrolyte having a common ion is called the common ion effect. 

$NH_4OH \leftrightarrows NH_4^+ + OH^-$  
$NH^4 \rightarrow NH_4^+ + Cl^-$

When more $NH_4CL$ enters the solution, the reverse reaction will take place in the first reaction, nullifying its effect. 

# 23. Molality 

$$
\text{Molality} = \frac{\text{Gram moles of solute}}{\text{Volume of solvent in kg}}\\
\implies \frac{\text{Mass of solute in g/molar mass}}{\text{Volume of solvent in g/1000}}
$$

# 24. Molarity 

$$
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Gram moles of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in liter}}\\
\implies \frac{\text{Mass of solute in g/molar mass}}{\text{Volume of solvent in ml}/1000}
$$

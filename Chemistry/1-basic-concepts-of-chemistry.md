# Introduction

- Types of mixture:
  - Homogeneous
  - Heterogeneous

$\text{Mixture} \rightarrow \text{Solute} + \text{Solvent}$  
$\text{Salt water} \rightarrow \text{Salt (Dispersed particle)} + \text{Water (Dispersal medium)}$

> Heterogeneous solutions can be divided separately

# SI Units

| Quantity          | Unit          |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Length            | meter (m)     |
| Mass              | kilogram (kg) |
| Time              | second (s)    |
| Temperature       | Kelvin (K)    |
| Current           | Ampere (A)    |
| Luminosity        | candela (cd)  |
| Molecules present | mole (mol)    |

## Conversion of Temperature 

$K = \degree C + 273$  
$\degree F = \frac{9}{5}(\degree C) + 32$  
$\degree C = (\degree F - 32) \cdot \frac{5}{9}$

# Laws of Cheimcal Combination 

## 1. Law of Conservation of Mass 

$\text{Mass of Reactant = Mass of Product}$

In all physical changes and chemical reactions, the total mass of the product is the same as the total mass of the reactant. 

## 2. Law of Definite/Constant Proportion 

A pure chemical compound always consists of the same elements combined in a fixed proportion by weight 

# Dalton's Atomic Theory 

1. Matter is made up of extremely small particles called atoms. 
2. Atoms of the same element are identical.
3. Atoms of different elements differ in all the properties. 
4. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed. 

> [!CAUTION] Limitation
> **Doesn't apply to isotopes because they have different mass.**

## Limitation

$\text{It does not apply to isotopes because they have different masses.}$

# Modern Atomic Theory 

1. Atoms are no longer indivisible 
2. Atoms of the same elements may have different atomic masses. 
3. Atoms of different elements may have the same atomic mass. 
4. Atoms are no longer indestructible. 

# Atomic Mass Unit

1 amu (atomic mass unit) = mass of $\frac{1}{12}$ of carbon-12 atom. 

- An Exact 1 kg block made of Platinum and Iridium is stored in Paris and shared to differnt parts of the world.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Relative**: measured in relation to  
> **Absolute**: number of atoms (independent)

> [!NOTE] Example
> Sulfur = 32 amu {relative mass}

# Average Atomic Mass 

$Cl \rightarrow 35 \rightarrow 75$%  
$Cl \rightarrow 37 \rightarrow 25$%  
$\because \text{They are in rationof 3:1}$

Average atomic number = $\frac{35 \cdot 3 + 37 \cdot 1}{3+1}$  
$\implies 35.5 u$ {u = unified mass}

# Gram Atomic Mass 

Atomic mass, $N$ = 14 $u$

The quantity of an element whose mass in grams is numerically equal to its relative atomic mass. It is also called on gram atom. 

1 gram atom of $N = 14g$  
1 gram atom of $S = 32g$
1 gram atom of $H_2O = 18g$

# Avogadro's Hypothesis 

Under similar conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain an equal number of molecules. 

## Application 

1. Determination of atomicity 
   - Eg:
     - $H_2SO_4 \rightarrow 2+1+4 = 7$
     - $2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O$
     - 2 + 1 = 3
     - $\therefore 1 + \frac{1}{2} \rightarrow \frac{3}{2}$
> [!NOTE]
> One molecule of water contains one molecule of hydrogen and 1/2 molecule of oxygen.

2. Relationship between Molar mass and vapor density  
$\text{Vapor Density} \frac{\text{Mass of Vml of any gas}}{\text{Mass of Vml of }H_2}$  
$OR$  
$VD = \frac{\text{Mass of 1 molecule of gas (molar mass)}}{\text{Mass of 3 atom of Hydrogen}}$

> [!IMPORTANT]
> $\text{Molar mass} = 2 \cdot VD$

# Mole Concept

1 mole = $6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$ number of particles {$N_A$ = Avogadro's number}

1 mole of Carbon atom = $6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$ number of carbon atom

1 mole of water = $6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$ number of water molecule

Mass of 1 mole of C-atom = 12 g  
Mass of 1 mole of $H_2O$ = 18 g   
36 g of water = 2 mol 

1 atom = $4 e^-$  
1 mole atom = $4 \cdot N_A$

# Volume in Terms of Mole 

Gram molecular of gas = Gram molecular volume  
$\implies \text{molar volume} = 22.4 \text{ liter}$

Under NTP/STP (Normal Temperature Pressure/Standard Temperature Pressure)

Temperature = 273 K   
Pressure = 1 atm (atmospheric pressure)

# Empirical Formula 

The formula of a compound gives the simple whole number ratio of the atoms of various elements present in one molecule of a compound. 

Molecular Formula of glucose: $C_6H_{12}O_6$  
Emperical formula: $CH_2O$

## Relation between Molecular Formula and Emperical Formula 

Molecular formula = N x [Emperical Formula](#emperical-formula)  
- n is the simple whole-number ratio 

## Determination of the Empirical formula of a Compound 

1. Write the percentage of the different elements involved in the formula. Then write the atomic mass of the element involved.

2. Divide the percentage of each element by its atomic mass to calculate the gram atoms or moles of the element.
   - Gram Atom (moles) = $\frac{\text{percentage of element}}{\text{Atomic mass}}$

3. Divide the gram atoms or moles of different elements by the smallest among them to find the atomic ratio or molar ratio.

4. Raise the atomic or molar ratio of the element to the nearest whole number. If necessary, multiply by suitable integers. 

# Limiting Reagent/Reactant
In a chemical reaction, one of the reactants may be present in lesser amounts while the other may be present in excess. The reactant which is present in lesser amounts is known as the limiting reagent/reactant.

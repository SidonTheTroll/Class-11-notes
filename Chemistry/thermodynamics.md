**Thermo**: heat  
**Dynamics**: flow (flow of heat) | Heat = energy 

**Energetics**: movement of energy 

- **System**: It is the specific part of the universe in which energy changes take place. 
- **Surrounding**: It represents the rest of the universe which surrounds the system. 

> Either energy goes out of system or enters it. 
> Chemistry considers the system whereas physics considers surrounding. 

## Types of System

1. **Open system**: A system is said to be open if both mass and energy can be exchanged with the surrounding. Eg: uncovered tea cup.
2. **Closed system**: A system where only heat is exchanged (exchange of energy) with the surrounding and no exchange of mass take place. Eg: tea cup covered with plate.
3. **Isolated system**: A system is said to be isolated if neither mass nor heat can be exchanged with the surrounding. Eg: tea in a thermo-flux.
4. **Homogeneous system**: If all the constituent of the system are present in same phase and same composition, it is known as homogeneous system. Eg: salt + water. 
5. **Heterogeneous system**: A system where two or more constituent are present. Eg: sand + water. 

## Intensive and Extensive Property 

- **Intensive properties**: The properties of a system which do not depend upon either the size or quantity of matter present in it. Eg: pressure, temperature, density, surface tension, viscosity, refractive index, melting and boiling point, etc. 

- **Extensive Property**: The properties of a system which depends upon either the size or quantity of matter present in it. Eg: mass, volume, internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy.

## Thermodynamic State Function

If a system undergoes changs as a result of chemical reaction, it can describe before and after the change in terms of certain properties. Such as pressue, volume, temperature, etc. These are known as state function, which can describe the state of function. 

- List of State functions
    1. Enthalpy 
    2. Free energy
    3. Internal energy
    4. Entropy 
    5. Nunber of moles
    6. Pressue 
    7. Volume 
    8. Temperature

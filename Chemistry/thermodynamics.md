# Introduction 

**Thermo**: heat  
**Dynamics**: flow (flow of heat) | Heat = energy 

**Energetics**: movement of energy 

- **System**: It is the specific part of the universe in which energy changes take place. 
- **Surrounding**: It represents the rest of the universe which surrounds the system. 

> Either energy goes out of system or enters it. 
> Chemistry considers the system whereas physics considers surrounding. 

## Types of System

1. **Open system**: A system is said to be open if both mass and energy can be exchanged with the surrounding. Eg: uncovered tea cup.
2. **Closed system**: A system where only heat is exchanged (exchange of energy) with the surrounding and no exchange of mass take place. Eg: tea cup covered with plate.
3. **Isolated system**: A system is said to be isolated if neither mass nor heat can be exchanged with the surrounding. Eg: tea in a thermo-flux.
4. **Homogeneous system**: If all the constituent of the system are present in same phase and same composition, it is known as homogeneous system. Eg: salt + water. 
5. **Heterogeneous system**: A system where two or more constituent are present. Eg: sand + water. 

## Intensive and Extensive Property 

- **Intensive properties**: The properties of a system which do not depend upon either the size or quantity of matter present in it. Eg: pressure, temperature, density, surface tension, viscosity, refractive index, melting and boiling point, etc. 

- **Extensive Property**: The properties of a system which depends upon either the size or quantity of matter present in it. Eg: mass, volume, internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy.

## Thermodynamic State Function

If a system undergoes changs as a result of chemical reaction, it can describe before and after the change in terms of certain properties. Such as pressue, volume, temperature, etc. These are known as state function, which can describe the state of function. 

- List of State functions
    1. Enthalpy 
    2. Free energy
    3. Internal energy
    4. Entropy 
    5. Nunber of moles
    6. Pressue 
    7. Volume 
    8. Temperature 

## Thermodynamic Process 

1. **Iso-thermal process**: the temperature of system remains constant.
    - dt = 0

2. **Adiabetec process**: no exchange of heat between system and surrounding is possible (system is isolated)
    - dq (heat) = 0 

3. **Isobaric process**: when the pressure remains constant throughout the process. 
    - dP (perssure) = 0 

> Change in volumme may not take place. 

4. Isochoric process: Process carried out in constant volume. 
    - dV = 0 

> Change in pressure may not take place. 

5. **Cyclic process**: when a system undergoes a series of change and finally returns to initial state. 
    - dE = 0 
    - Change in energy

## Mode of Energy Exchange 

### 1. As heat energy 

The heat from the system escapes to the surrounding or vice versa. 

$\therefore \text{Heat q is -ve (if transferred from system to surrounding)}$

If the heat is transferred from the surrounding from the system,  
$\therefore \text{Heat (q) is +ve)}$

### 2. As Work Energy 

1. Mechanical Work (P-V Work): This is perhaps the most common form of work discussed in thermodynamics. It occurs when a system's volume changes while it is exposed to an external pressure. The formula for mechanical work, often denoted as W, is given by:

$W = -P\Delta V$

Where:

W is the work done on the system (positive if work is done on the system, negative if done by the system).  
P is the external pressure.  
$\Delta V$ is the change in volume of the system.  

2. Electrical Work: This type of work involves the movement of charged particles, typically electrons, and is important in electrochemistry. The formula for electrical work is:

$W = -qV$

Where:

W is the work done.  
q is the charge moved.  
V is the potential difference (voltage) across which the charge is moved.  
Other Forms of Work: Depending on the specific situation, work can also take forms such as shaft work (e.g., in rotating equipment), surface work (e.g., when a gas expands against a piston), and more. Each of these forms of work has its own associated equations and considerations.

Work energy exchange is a crucial concept in thermodynamics because it helps describe how energy is transferred between a system and its surroundings during various processes. It is essential for understanding and calculating changes in the internal energy of a system, as defined by the first law of thermodynamics, which relates changes in internal energy (ΔU), heat transfer (Q), and work done (W) as follows:

$ΔU = Q - W$

Where:

ΔU is the change in internal energy.  
Q is the heat added to or removed from the system.  
W is the work done on or by the system.  

# Mechanical Work or Perress Volume Work

1. Work done during expansion 

Consider an ideal gas (1 ATP or NTP) enclosed in a cylinder fitted with a weightless and frictionless piston having an area of cross section 'A'. Let 'v' be the volume of gas and P be the pressue acting on the system. 

$\therefore \text{Pressure} = \frac{force}{area}$  
$\implies P = \frac{f}{a}$  
$\implies f = P \cdot a$ {Equation 1}

If the piston moves outward through a distance 'dl',

$\therefore W = \text{foce} \cdot \text{distance}$  
$\implies -f \cdot dl$  
$\implies -P \cdot a \cdot dl$ {From Equation 1}  
$dW = -P \cdot dv$ [Negative since the system is doing the work]

In case the system expands from a finite volume $v_1$ to $v_2$ during the change, 

$\therefore \text{Work done by the system will be,}$  

$W = -P$  
$W = -P \int_{v_1}^{v_2} dv$  
$W = -P [v_2 - v_1]$  
$W = -P \Delta V$

2. Work done during contraction

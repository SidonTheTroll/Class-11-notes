# Aromatic Hydrocarbons

These are hydrocarbons that are cyclic and have alternating double bond.  
Technically, **Huckle's Rule** is used to find it.  
It is $(4n+2)\pi e^-$  
n should be 1, 2, 3...

Benzene is aromatic because,  
$$
(4n + 2) \pi 
\implies 4 * 1 + 2 = 2\pi 
\therefore 6\pi \text{is the number of} \pi\text{-electrons this compound has.}
$$

Same can be found for naphelene. 

The below compound is also aromatic because it follows Huckle's rule. It can be found out by creating its resonance structure. 

# Orbital Structure of Benzene 

- Benzene $a-e^-$ cloud is found above and under the structure. 


# Methods of Preparation 

1. By Decarboxilation 

2. Reduction of Phenol 

3. Polymerization Reaction 

4. Wurtz Fittig Reaction

5. From Dizonium Salt 

- Melting and Boiling point of non-polar compounds are found by Van-Der Walle's force. 

> Higher Van-Der Walle's force = higher melting and boiling point 

# Physical Properties of Aromatic Hydrocarbons 

1. $C_6$ to $C_8$ are colorless liquid with charactersitic smell. 
2. All aromatic hydrocarbons don't dissolve in water because they are non-polar. 

# Chemical Properties 

## 1. Halogenation 

> This process is same for bromination even the catalyst 

$\therefore$ Nitric acid is used as a catalyst to prevent the reversion. 

## 2. **Nitration**

### Mechanism 

## Saphonation 

## Chlorination 

# Friedel Crafts Alkylation

# Friedel Crafts Asylation 

# Directive Influence 

## Ortho-Para directing groups
